Your From Email address is the address you use to send emails from and receive replies.\nDue to email regulatory policy, if you use an email address from a free service provider such as @gmail.com, @yahoo.com, or @outlook.com, your emails will have a low delivery rate, because mail services may not accept marketing emails sent from free email addresses. To help you ensure that most of your contacts receive your emails, we will change your From Email to an authenticated address owned by Strikingly.\nHow Strikingly Helps Your Delivery Rates.\nIf you enter a free email address as your From Email, we\u2019ll automatically make a change to your email address each time you send an email. All the changes are on our side, so you can keep using your free email domain and we'll handle the rest.\nWe\u2019ll use the @send.mystrikingly.com subdomains as the From domain for your email address when you send. Replies from the recipient will still go to your original email address.\nFor example, if your email is example@gmail.com, we will modify it to example.gmail.com@send.mystrikingly.com.\nNote: This solution will help, but it can\u2019t fix all delivery issues. We strongly recommend using a custom domain email (e.g. hello@yourdomain.com) for your From Email, which builds trust with recipients and looks more professional.

These details will be shown when the recipient opens your email in their inbox.\nIn the From Email field, you may use a custom email address to send emails from and receive replies. This From Email must follow some important rules:\nIf the email address is on a free service (e.g. Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo, Proton), your emails are more likely to be marked as spam! We strongly recommend using a custom domain for this instead.\nIf the email address is on a domain that is managed on Strikingly, you don\u2019t need to do anything else! We\u2019ll handle the validation automatically.\nIf the email address is on a domain that is managed by a third-party registrar (e.g. Godaddy, Namecheap, etc), then you\u2019ll need to add DKIM authentication to your domain in order to properly send emails from that email address. To do this, follow the instructions below.\nYou'll learn how to do the domain authentication (DKIM) exactly in this article.\nRegistrar-specific guides\nIf your email domain is from one of the following providers, instead of following the general instructions, you can check the step-by-step guides for your own providers:\n1&1 IONOS\n101 Domain\n123 Reg\nBluehost\nGandi\nGoDaddy\nNamecheap\nNetwork Solutions\nOVH\nRegister.com\nStep 1: Check the DNS records you need for your email domain authentication in Strikingly Site Editor\nGo to your Strikingly site editor and click \"Settings\" > \"Email Notifications\".\nAdd your email to the \"From Email\" field.\nEnter the 6-digit code sent to your email to verify it.\nClick \u201cAuthenticate Email Domain\u201d\nChoose your domain provider, and click \u201cStart Configuration\u201d.\nYou will see a popup that displays the records you'll need to set in your domain settings.\nStep 2: Add three CNAME Records and one TXT record in your domain provider\n1. In your domain provider\u2019s account, find the DNS Settings for your domain. (It may also be called DNS, DNS manager, DNS records, host record, zone settings, zone file, etc.)\n2. Add a new record, and set the Type to CNAME.\n3. Copy the \u201cName\u201d and \u201cValue\u201d of one of the CNAME records from Strikingly, and paste it into the corresponding places.\n\u201cName\u201d may also be called \u201cAlias\u201d or \u201cHost\u201d.\n\u201cValue\u201d may also be called \u201cRecord\u201d, \u201cAddress\u201d, \u201cPoints to\u201d or \u201cData\u201d.\n4. Select \"Default\" for TTL.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 to add two more CNAME records.\n6. Add one more record and set the Type to TXT.\n7. Copy and paste the \u201cName\u201d and \u201cValue\u201d of the TXT record.\n8. Select \"Default\" for TTL.\nNote: Some registrars automatically include the root domain in the Name/Alias/Host. In this case, you only need to enter the part up to \"_domainkey\" (for CNAME) and \"_amazonses\" (for TXT).\nStep 3: Wait for the Records to Take Effect\nAfter you\u2019ve confirmed the above setup, go back to your Strikingly site editor and click the \"I've added, start checking\" button in the popup.\nWe\u2019ll automatically detect your DNS records. please allow up to 48 hours for the changes in the domain records to take effect globally.\nAfter we detect the correct values, you\u2019ll be notified by email immediately. You\u2019ll also see a green message here, indicating that you've successfully set up DKIM authentication for your domain.\nIf we can\u2019t detect the correct values after 48 hours, you\u2019ll be notified by email.

This is important if you want to show different language or regional versions of your site to different types of visitors. This guide will walk you through the process of adding HREFLANG code to your web pages effectively.\nStep 1: Understand HREFLANG Tags\nBefore diving into the implementation, let's go over how HREFLANG tags work. These tags are placed in the <head> section of your HTML code and indicate the language and regional targeting of a specific web page. HREFLANG tags are typically added in the form of HTML link elements and contain information such as language codes and country codes.\nHere's an example of an HREFLANG tag:\n<link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"en\" href=\"https://example.com/en/page\">\nIn this example, en represents the English language, and https://example.com/en/page is the URL of the English version of the page.\nSee Google's official guide here for a list of supported language/region codes.\nStep 2: Plan Your HREFLANG Strategy\nBefore you start implementing HREFLANG tags, plan your international SEO strategy. Determine which languages and regions you want to target and create a list of the URLs for each language and region. Each URL should show the appropriate content for that language or region. You can do this by building separate pages or sites for each language or region you want to target.\nStep 3: Add HREFLANG Tags to Your HTML\nNow, let's add HREFLANG tags to your web pages. Follow these steps:\nGo to the \"Custom Code\" editor of your site: In the editor of the site you would like to add HREFLANG code to, click on \"Settings\" -> \"Show Advanced\" -> \"Custom Code\"\nMake sure you are on the \"Header Code\" tab.\u00a0This is where you'll insert your HREFLANG tags.\nDefine a default language/region first: Decide on a default language or region that you want to show to users when their preferences don't match any of the specified HREFLANG tags. This default version should be the most widely understood or the version of your content that is most relevant to a global audience. (A rule of thumb is to use the language that you started your website in as the default.) Here's an example that uses the English version of the page as default:\n<link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"x-default\" href=\"https://example.com/en/page\">\nInsert HREFLANG tags for all languages: For each language/region version of the page, insert an HREFLANG tag. Here's the general format:\n<link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"language-code\" href=\"URL\">\nReplace language-code with the appropriate language code (e.g., \"en\" for English) or\u00a0 x-default for your default language version. Replace URL with the URL of the corresponding language/region version of the page.\nThe final result should look something like this:\n<link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"x-default\" href=\"https://example.com/en/page\">\n<link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"es\" href=\"https://example.com/es/pagina\"><link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"de\" href=\"https://example.com/de/seite\">\nSave and publish your website: Click the green \"Save\" button to save the code, then publish your website.\nWait for search engines to re-index your site, which may take a few days or up to a week. Search results should soon reflect these language settings.\nWas this article helpful?\n0 out of 0 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

It provides personalized guidance, expert advice, and hands-on assistance to help users build a professional and effective website. In a nutshell, we create websites for you.\nHow does it work?\n1. To subscribe to our Kickstart program, you need to\u00a0go to this page\u00a0and choose the kind of site you need.\n2. Based on the category you select, it will prompt another question associated with that category. This screenshot shows the next questions after choosing the \"Creative\" category.\n3. Let's say we chose \"Art and Design\" as the type of creative website. This is how the next page will look.\nNote:\u00a0It will ask you to choose from the template suggestions.\nIf you don't want to choose a template, it also has an option to \"Skip & let Design Expert decide\":\n4. After selecting templates and clicking the \"Go get my site\" button, it will route you to the page where you need to select a package for your Kickstart program:\n5. Once you have selected a package, you need to pay for it upfront.\nNote: Kickstart is only available for accounts on a paid plan. Check our plans and pricing here.\nWhat will happen after?\n1. Our design team needs approximately 48-72 hours to build your site after we receive your materials. During this timeframe, you just need to sit tight while we work on your project, no need to do anything! If the team requires additional information or upon completion of the website, they will promptly notify you. Once successful, you can view the site's first draft on the\u00a0Kickstart page.\n2. If there's a need to modify any content, we can still help you make the changes you need\u00a0within 7 days\u00a0after the first submission. During this period, you can also follow up or contact us. On the KickStart page, click the \"I Need Edits\" button to list down your requests or attach any images or files if needed.\nNote: Before the first draft is ready, you won't see this button.\n3. Once you're satisfied with the site design, click \"Approve\" on the KickStart page. This way, the system can transfer the site to your account, and the site is all yours to customize!\nNotes:\nThe Kickstart Program payment is non-refundable.\nWe do not offer image editing or design services. Please provide us with the images or written content you wish to use for your site.\nIf you have video content to add to your site, you can upload it to YouTube or Vimeo, set the privacy setting to Public, and then share the URL with us. This way, we can add it to your site.\nAfter submitting the edit request, our design team will need 24-48 hours, depending on the workload of your request.\nThe KickStart program includes the following services: website building (multiple pages - supporting up to 7 pages), uploading a maximum of 5 products, publishing a maximum of 3 blog posts, and adding membership tiers (Pro - one tier, VIP - 5 tiers).\nIf you need more help, send us a line at\u00a0support@strikingly.com\u00a0or\u00a0chat\u00a0with us.\nWas this article helpful?\n0 out of 0 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

However, there are instances when you need to highlight one call-to-action button with a different color, then leave the rest. Here's how to do that:\nHow do I change or edit the color of a specific button on my website?\n1. In your site editor, hover over the button you wish to modify or change and click \"EDIT\".\n2. Click the color selector button and pick a color from the color selection.\nOr pick a color that's not in the palette by clicking the \"CUSTOM\" option.\n3. Move the selector in the color tool or if you have a specific color hex code, you can type it in the color toolbox. Hit \"DONE\" when the color you want has been set.\nNote:\nThe button font color changes automatically to either dark or light, depending on how dark or light your button color is.\nFor example, you chose black as your button color. The font color changes automatically to white, so the contrast is maintained, making it easier for your visitors to read the button labels.\nHow do I change the button font?\nIf you want to change the button font, here are the steps:\n1. Go to Styles >> Fonts >> Button:\n2. Choose your preferred font style from the options. You can even upload your own fonts:\nNote:\nChoosing the font will automatically change the font style of your button.\nUploading a custom font requires a domain connected to your website.\nChanging the font of one button will apply to all buttons on your website.\nEmail us at\u00a0support@strikingly.com\u00a0or\u00a0chat\u00a0with us\u00a0in case you need help on anything!\nIf you'd like to change font color, check out\u00a0this article.\nWas this article helpful?\n0 out of 0 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

However, if you\u2019d like to get a more granular report on how your websites are faring in terms of site traffic, you can use Google Analytics.\nGoogle Analytics is a free service offered by Google that allows website owners to get comprehensive website traffic reports. These reports include new vs returning visitors, which countries the visits came from, how much time they spent on the site, etc.\nTo add Google Analytics to your site:\nStep 1: Get Your Analytics Tracking ID From GoogleStep 2: Enter Your Tracking ID into Your Strikingly Site\nClick here if you connected your Google Analytics code (Universal Analytics tracker) before April 24, 2023.\nStep 1: Get Your Analytics Tracking ID From Google\n1. Go to Google Analytics, and be sure to login in to your Gmail account. Click \u201cStart measuring\u201d.\n2. \u201cAdd an account name\u201d, and click \u201cNext\u201d.\n3. On the next screen, fill in your \u201cProperty name\u201d in the box, and click \u201cNext\u201d.\n4. Follow the steps and fill the necessary info you\u2019re asked for. In choosing your business objectives, tick the boxes on the options you\u2019d want or need. In this case, we picked \u201cExamine user behavior\u201d. Click \u201cCreate\u201d after picking an option.\n5. Accept Google\u2019s Terms and proceed to the next page. Choose \u201cWeb\u201d from the options, then click Next.\n6. In the Data Stream setup, fill in your website URL and stream name, then hitCreate Stream.\n7. Copy the Measurement ID (it looks like this, \u201cG-XXXXXXXXXX\u201d). You'll need it in step 2.\n8. Click \"X\" to close the page with the ID. You'll see this page, click Next:\n9. You will then be redirected to a page saying that the data collection is pending and that it needs up to 48 hours to complete, click Continue to Home.\nStep 2: Enter Your Tracking ID into Your Strikingly Site\n11. Go back to the site editor and navigate to Settings > Show Advanced > Services.\n12. Paste the tracking code you copied (G-XXXXXXXXXX) in the Google Analytics field. Click \u201cSave\u201d, then publish the changes.\nNote: You may have to wait up to 30 minutes before you see any activity in your Google Analytics dashboard (Real-time reports). The actual data collection will start approximately 48 hours after installation.\nYou should see that the code is already working when you see this in your Google Analytics dashboard.\nIf you added your Google Analytics code (Universal Analytics tracker) before April 24, 2023:\nFor previously added UA (Universal Analytics) tracking code to any of your websites, we\u2019ve updated our Google Analytics integration to make it compatible with GA4. Google will retire its Universal Analytics tracker on July 1, 2023, and your UA tracking code stop working. Please follow these steps to ensure that visitor activity and traffic will still be tracked in Google Analytics when this change takes effect.\nTo prepare for this update, we placed a reminder in \u201cMy Sites\u201d, on top of your websites\u2019 list. This reminder contains the following:\nA link to access your Google Analytics account\nsite editor links of your sites that are still using the Universal Analytics Tracker.\nHow To Create a New GA4 Property for websites using UA tracker.\n1. Go to your Google Analytics account by clicking the \u201cplease create a new Google Analytics 4 (GA4) property on Google Analytics\u201d link in the dashboard reminder or the site editor of one of those sites in Settings > Advanced > Services.\n2. In your Google Analytics account, look for the property associated with the website you are working on that\u2019s still connected with a Universal Analytics tracker. Click the GA4 Setup Assistant\u00a0option and hit Get Started.\n3. Click Create and continue\u00a0on the prompt and wait for the screen to load the next step.\n4. On the \u201cSet up a Google tag\u201d screen, copy the tracker (it looks like this, \u201cG-XXXXXXXXXX\u201d) in the Google tag code box.\n5. Go back to the site editor and navigate to Settings > Show Advanced > Services. Replace the UA-XXXXXXXX-X code in the Google Analytics field with the code you copied from the previous step. Click \u201cSave\u201d, then publish the changes.\n6. Go back to Google Analytics and click \"Test Installation\".\nOnce the tracking code is updated to GA4 and the site is published, the reminder will also disappear from the site editor settings.\nNote: It may take up to 30 minutes before you see any activity in your Google Analytics dashboard (Real-time reports). The actual data collection will start approximately 48 hours after installation.\nIf you need help, email us at\u00a0support@strikingly.com\u00a0or\u00a0chat with us.\nWas this article helpful?\n1 out of 1 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

They also made a public commitment to support their employees, something that everyone wants.\nIt was timely. The post was added in January, New Year\u2019s, a time when people write their own resolutions (but never really do\u2013for some).\n\ud83d\udca1 Idea: Create your own New Year\u2019s Resolution list and include building a website\nFacebook continues to be the reigning champion for social media websites. It\u2019s still a great space to keep your audience informed and in the loop. When you create posts, keep an eye out for:\nNice graphics. Facebook is viewed on mobile devices and desktop computers. Your images should look nice, so keep an eye out for your image pixels!\nTimeliness. Time your posts depending on the season, and days. Here\u2019s a quick tip on when\u2019s the best time to post on Facebook.\nTwitter\n@github\nComments: 8\nRetweets: 102\nLikes: 352\n\ud83d\udc4d\u00a0 Why we like this post:\nIt\u2019s the first release for the new year. People are always excited about new features, and the post is just timely.\nThe bold yet plain share image is enough to make the audience stop when they scroll through their Twitter feed.\n\ud83d\udca1 Idea: Compile Strikingly\u2019s new feature releases (we release new features every week!) and tweet it as a thread every month!\n@SauravPurohit4\nComments: 35\nRetweets: 504\nLikes: 1.8K\n\ud83d\udc4d\u00a0 Why we like this post:\nIt's a personal testimonial and inspiration.

Unlike other threads that seem to just go on and on, the audience expectations are set properly.\n\ud83d\udca1 Idea: Create your own personal testimonial like, \u201cI am a Strikingly expert..\u201d and list down your favorite features.\n@infospikedotcom\nComments: 19\nRetweets: 642\nLikes: 1,866\n\ud83d\udc4d\u00a0 Why we like this post:\nIt\u2019s bold and creates a very strong statement. It resonates with her audience well.\nThe post answers the most common questions posted by anyone who wants to have his/her own business.

Ask.\n\ud83d\udca1 Idea: Create bold statements and answer basic website-building questions\nTwitter is a place where most brands and businesses try to dig deeper into their target audience's interests. When you make tweets, here are a few reminders:\nBuild your profile first. Follow relevant people and grow your audience.\nDon\u2019t try to sell all the time. Offer value and advice. Add humor. People don\u2019t like being sales talked.\nAlways use the right hashtags to reach more people.\nInstagram\nHubSpot\nLikes: 2,773\nComments: 134\n\ud83d\udc4d\u00a0 Why we like this post:\nThe graphics are clean, and the important elements are in big, bold letters.\nThe post shows a number that is presented as a fact. Using numbers to make claims is better than just stating the fact. It\u2019s just more believable.\nThe post makes sense, and it\u2019s something that people actually experience. Ads are more personalized because it resonates with people\u2019s stories. Add that with a number and shazam! Powerful message.\n\ud83d\udca1 Idea: Find an interesting website/startup/e-commerce statistic online, make a graphic, and post it on IG. Something like, \u201c44% of small businesses plan to have a website in 2021.\u201d\nSimplydigital.gr\nViews: 62K\nComments: 82\n\ud83d\udc4d\u00a0 Why we like this post:\nIt\u2019s him again! Tiktok-type videos are just perfect anywhere because they are so easy to consume because they\u2019re short.\nJust like his TikTok videos, he introduces his content in the first few seconds.\nHis information is really valuable because it benefits everyone, not just a specific type of person.\nHis video feels amateurish, and it works. Anyone who watches his video feels like they can do the same exact video without any professional skills or help. Again, relatable.\n\ud83d\udca1 Idea: 6 Strikingly Features I Am Obsessed With\nMarketingharry\nLikes: 1,302\nComments: 213\n\ud83d\udc4d\u00a0 Why we like this post:\nIt\u2019s a list, but it\u2019s not the usual list. A tad creative in terms of presentation, but it didn\u2019t sacrifice the message that it wants to get across.\nThe description is a summary of the information on the image. If you can\u2019t read the image (Because small device screen? Looking at you, iPhone 13 mini), you\u2019d still be compelled because of the \u201cteaser\u201d on the description.\nIt\u2019s how to make money ON INSTAGRAM, posted on INSTAGRAM. It\u2019s not how to make money on Instagram, posted on Facebook.

They created a series of images that created anticipation.\n\u201cTrends\u201d + Current Year = Very timely post.\n\ud83d\udca1 Idea: Website design trends in 2022 (and showcase screenshots of actual Strikingly websites)\nInstagram is highly visual, but you don\u2019t need a very visual product to market on IG. When you create posts, always do the following:\nCreate well-crafted photos and visuals. There are a lot of free tools out there for you to use, so use them!\nUse Instagram Stories\u2013they come in slideshow formats, and they always appear on top of your follower timelines.\nAdd video shorts. Videos are perfect for every social media channel.\nPinterest\n26 Things to Note Before You Develop a Website - Infographic\nRepins: 4,772\nSave: 4772\nLikes: 782\nComments: 9\n\ud83d\udc4d\u00a0 Why we like this pin:\nIt\u2019s an infographic with so much info included in one image.\nIt doesn\u2019t link me anywhere else. Pinterest can be a rabbit hole for links when all you need is an image.\n\ud83d\udca1 Idea: \u201c10 Things to Prepare Before You Build a Website\u201d (yeah, 26 can be too much)\nDamn LOL is coming soon\nRepins: 4,701\nSave: 31,243\nLikes: 2,025\nComments: 19\n\ud83d\udc4d\u00a0 Why we like this pin:\nIt features an amazing product\u2013real or not.\nIt shows how the product works without using any words or text.\nThe product details are clear, like a product manual. Very straightforward in communicating information.\n\ud83d\udca1 Idea: Create an anatomy of the Strikingly website builder\u2013show how easy it is to use.\n5 things you must do before making money with your blog\nRepins: 3,658\nSave: 3,658\nLikes: 642\nComments: 7\n\ud83d\udc4d\u00a0 Why we like this pin:\nThe title features 2 keywords: 5 and money. Five (5) means it\u2019s a short list, and money means that people can earn from it. People love short lists on how to earn.\nPinterest is used as a jump-off point to a blog post. This is useful to drive more traffic on your website or blog.\n\ud83d\udca1 Idea: Top 5 ways to make money from your Strikingly site.\nPinterest is a platform known for finding new ideas or sharing your new ideas. It\u2019s not the usual social media platform where you upload images of your recent vacation or catch up with friends. This implies that people who are on Pinterest are actively searching for new things. When you make pins, make sure that you:\nTurn your ideas into inspiring, engaging content. Your images should tell the story of your article or brand. Add context.\nUse a mix of images, videos, and blog posts. Videos do well in any social media platform, but images are really defaulted and can be easily repinned.\nDon\u2019t forget to add your link!\nOther Content\nOnline Courses\nFree Course: Beginner Web Design using HTML5, CSS3 & Visual Studio Code\nViews: 1,414,371 views\nLikes: 35K\nComments: 1,907\n\ud83d\udc4d\u00a0 Why we like this course:\nIt\u2019s free! We\u2019re all suckers for free. Even exercise files can be downloaded absolutely free.\nIt feels like an actual course because it\u2019s 4 hours\u2013like your extended college class over the weekend.\nAlthough the video is 4 hours long, it\u2019s a teaser for an entire course (28 videos) that can be accessed via a monthly subscription.\n\ud83d\udca1 Idea: Create one (1) free online course on how to create a website on Strikingly, and a series of paid courses that features how to set up powerful e-commerce, or gain more traffic for your Strikingly e-commerce store.\nSEO success with Tim Soulo: Tips for Course creators\nViews: 68K\nLikes: 62\n\ud83d\udc4d\u00a0 Why we like this course:\nIt\u2019s an interactive course in an interview format. It\u2019s more interactive than just one person speaking.\nThe course is short at 39:34 minutes.\nThe introduction didn\u2019t even take 1 minute! Some course creators spend minutes introducing themselves and their sponsors\u2013boring.\n\ud83d\udca1 Idea: Get a friend and have this friend interview you about creating websites on Strikingly. Prepare a script if you need to but make it look more spontaneous.\nFree Canva Beginner\u2019s Course\nStudents: Over 10,000 people completed the course\n\ud83d\udc4d\u00a0 Why we like this course:\nIt\u2019s a free course, and it\u2019s very easy to sign up.\nIt has its own website page, but the courses are done via a Facebook Group. This is something that you can also replicate.\nThe course only takes an hour. Not too long, and I don\u2019t have to set aside half of my day to finish an entire course.\n\ud83d\udca1 Idea: Create your own website with Strikingly, offer a free course, and share your affiliate link with your students.\nOnline courses are a great way to sell Strikingly to your audience because you're not just selling them Strikingly, you're also teaching them a new set of skills. You can also monetize your course content by creating a series. When you go this route, always remember to:\nAlways create an outline and include it in your video or comments. This way, your audience knows exactly what they will learn.\nProvide good visuals and screen shares. A blurry video will make elements hard to read, and your students won't know what you're clicking.\nProvide exercises. This will stimulate learning and will make your students feel like \"actual students\" who are actually learning something.\nQ&A Websites\nQuora: There are tons of website builders out there (Wix, Strikingly, WordPress, and the list goes on!). Which one of them do I know is the best fit for my startup?\n\ud83d\udc4d\u00a0 Why we like this post:\nThe \u201casker\u201d asked a valid question. With tons of options out there, how do you choose the right website builder for your startup?\nIt\u2019s an open platform, and anyone can answer.\n\ud83d\udca1 Idea: Respond to questions of this sort. Either include a link to your website where your affiliate link is, or add your own affiliate link to your response.\nReddit: In 18 months, I went from no coding experience to selling apps to the NBA, NHL, and Berkshire Hathaway. Then, I released my code under a public license. 2-year follow-up, AMA!\n\ud83d\udc4d\u00a0 Why we like this post:\nThe post is a testimonial\u2013how the Redditor who had no idea how to code went to selling apps and got rich from it. He documented his story.\nPeople love success stories. And they always derive lessons from somebody else\u2019s experience.\n\ud83d\udca1 Idea: Document your affiliate marketing journey with Strikingly: from day 1 to your first sale.\nProduct Hunt: Startup Stash\n\ud83d\udc4d\u00a0 Why we like this post:\nA very useful list of applications that are useful for startups. Startups are the core drivers of innovation\u2013and they are everywhere! They\u2019re also looking for tools.\nIt\u2019s an open thread, and anyone can comment.\n\ud83d\udca1 Idea: Respond to posts about startup tools, or create your own list and post it on different forums.\nQ&A Websites allow you to create quality backlinks to your website or affiliate link just by answering questions. When you answer questions, make sure that you:\nOnly answer relevant questions. The goal is to get your answer upvoted, so it always shows up on top with your link. Avoid looking spammy by answering irrelevant questions.\nKeep it subtle. Don't sound too sales-y. People don't want to be sales talked about all the time.\nRespond to responses on your answer. This creates engagement and people are more to trust you.\nWas this article helpful?\n2 out of 2 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

Think of yourself as an evangelist and solutions provider with the main goal of helping people bring their ideas to life, expand their business globally, or kick-start their dream projects.\nThis document is a comprehensive guide that should help you position and pitch Strikingly to your customers, including a basic understanding of the value proposition that we offer. Here\u2019s a quick outline:\nWhat is Strikingly\nWhy build a website or eCommerce store now?\nWhy do people love Strikingly?\nPower Features For All You Need\nSimple Prices. Serious Value.\nAdditional Resources\nCreative Assets\nContent Topics\nWe hope that this resource helps you become a successful Strikingly affiliate and strengthen your sales pitch.\nWhat is Strikingly?\nStrikingly is the most loved website and e-commerce builder by entrepreneurs. We\u2019ve launched 12+ million websites & online stores \u2014 and counting!\nStrikingly\u2019s mission is to be the CTO for every entrepreneur. We were born in Silicon Valley, backed by Y Combinator & investors of Google and Facebook. We\u2019ve been featured on Forbes, New York Times, USA Today, and many more media outlets. Strikingly is known for two things: being ridiculously easy to use and having the best customer support. Building a website or storefront with Strikingly is as easy as making a slideshow.\nWhy build a website or eCommerce store now?\nThree words: Join. The. Revolution.\nYour buyers are online. There are 2.14 billion digital buyers, and e-commerce sales are expected to account for 18.1% of retail sales worldwide. They\u2019re online, and you should be too.\nCOVID changed how businesses are done. The pandemic triggered the digital and e-commerce turning point, and everyone went online. It\u2019s time to go all in and go online.\nTechnology is no longer the bogeyman. The no-code movement made technology less intimidating and more friendly. Your competitors are only online, and you don\u2019t want to miss out. FOMO is real.\nLast but not least, every entrepreneur, business, or even side project has a site or app these days. If you don't, it's hard to convince your audience or even your partners that you're legit.\nNow is the best time to start your business online. Launch your website or store in no time with Strikingly, and get your first customer today!\nWhy do people love Strikingly?\nStrikingly is the most loved website and e-commerce builder by entrepreneurs from around the world. We've launched 12M+ websites and stores. Here's what our users said: \"I don't need a CTO, Strikingly is my CTO.\"\nWhy do people love us? Here are two key reasons:\nRidiculously Easy to Use.\u00a0 Building a website with Strikingly is like building a slideshow, literally. If you have used Powerpoint or Keynote in the past, then you're more than capable of publishing a website with Strikingly. Don't believe me? Here's an example of how a blind man created his website with Strikingly and Wow'ed his job interviewers. Yes, that's how ridiculously easy Strikingly is.\nBest Customer Support. Our customer satisfaction score has been over 98.5% for the last 6 years straight. Our customer support team is called \"Happiness Officers\", and we aim to deliver happiness, not just satisfaction. Don't just take our word for it. Here's what our real customers are tweeting about us, and it\u2019s 100% unsolicited:\nhttps://twitter.com/Ankhto13er9_COB/status/1458150194508410885\nhttps://twitter.com/stemreads/status/1377424919131168771\nhttps://twitter.com/EoghanEvesson/status/1375425993859563521\nhttps://twitter.com/Nutritionist_AP/status/1347656879074385920\nhttps://twitter.com/hakimian45/status/1057341721590329351\nhttps://twitter.com/annelibby/status/1036348093686525952\nhttps://twitter.com/RobEdell/status/948328244239130624\nhttps://twitter.com/Fishica/status/1131068811732369408\nhttps://twitter.com/FinolaHoward/status/955890536728145920\nhttps://twitter.com/DeepakIsHereNow/status/891683599262523392\nhttps://twitter.com/Nikkisayswhat/status/1044210400722595840\nhttps://twitter.com/tabs365_us/status/956251442393894917?s=20\nOur support is 24/7 on both email and chat.

Apply to become a Strikingly Affiliate at https://www.strikingly.com/s/affiliate.\nHowever, we also have some legacy systems that earned lower commissions. All legacy affiliates should migrate to the latest Affiliate Program to earn the most commissions possible! We will deprecate legacy systems on December 31, 2022.\nHow do I know if I'm using an older system?\nThere are a few ways to check if you're using an older legacy system:\nIf you see an upgrade button on https://www.strikingly.com/s/affiliate, you're using an older system.\nOr, if your affiliate link starts with a.strk.ly or mbsy.co, you're using an older system. (The latest affiliate link will start with www.strikingly.com/a/)\nOr, if you logged into the affiliate system at https://affiliate.strikingly.com/login,\u00a0you're using an older system. (The latest affiliate dashboard is https://www.strikingly.com/s/affiliate.)\nHow do I migrate to the newest system?\nTo migrate to our new system, log into Strikingly and visit https://www.strikingly.com/s/affiliate. Make sure you've applied to our newest system.\nIf you see an upgrade button on the dashboard, just click it (\"Earn more commission now\") and follow the instructions on the screen to complete your upgrade. That's it!\nIf your link starts with a.strk.ly or mbsy.co, or if you accessed your affiliate dashboard from https://affiliate.strikingly.com/login, click the \"Migrate from legacy affiliate system\" button in the \"Links & Resources\" section.\nThis tool allows you to migrate existing a.strk.ly links to our new system, so you won't have to change those old links in your promotional content, but they will earn you commissions in our new Affiliate Program. (However, if you have been using mbsy.co\u00a0links, you will still need to update all the links in your content to your new link.)\nJust follow the instructions on the screen to migrate to the new system.\nWhat is the result of the migration?\nAfter migration and approval, you'll be able to earn our increased commissions! Please note that the increased commissions only apply to new referrals that you refer after you have completed the migration.\nWe hope you enjoy being a Strikingly Affiliate.

If that Visitor becomes a Premium Subscriber while the cookie is active, that constitutes a Qualified Purchase and makes the associated Affiliate eligible for a Referral Fee, pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.\nA. Delayed Credit for First Qualified Purchase\nThe first Qualified Purchase that is credited to an Affiliate does not immediately count toward that Affiliate\u2019s Referral Fees. Since Affiliates often generate their first would-be referral by self-referring (which is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement), Strikingly does not award any Referral Fees for the first Qualified Purchase for any Affiliate, whether they are in fact prohibited self-referrals or not. No Referral Fees will be attributed to an Affiliate who has only referred one (1) Premium Subscriber. To receive any Payouts or Referral Fees, each Affiliate must refer at least two (2) Premium Subscribers.\nUpon referral of the second Premium Subscriber who makes a Qualified Purchase, Strikingly will review the Affiliate\u2019s referrals and credit any and all subscriptions referred by the Affiliate under this Agreement.\nB. Qualified Purchases\nWhen an Affiliate is credited with a Qualified Purchase, that credit will appear on the Affiliate\u2019s Dashboard. Not every Qualified Purchase results in a Referral Fee. Strikingly gives new Premium Subscribers a Trial Period, a period during which they may cancel their subscription contracts without penalty. Affiliates who refer new Premium Subscribers that make Qualified Purchases only earn a Referral Fee if the new Premium Subscribers do not cancel during the trial period.\nC. Validation Period\nAfter the Premium Subscriber\u2019s Trial Period ends, a Validation Period runs during which Strikingly ensures that the Premium Subscriber does not dispute or cancel their account shortly after signing up. During the Validation Period, Strikingly verifies that each new Premium Subscriber sign-up is valid and not fraudulent before approving payment of the Referral Fee.\nIf the Premium User disputes any payment during the Validation Period, then the associated Referral Fee will be canceled, regardless of the outcome of said dispute.\nThe length of the Validation Period may vary depending on the subscription term of the Premium Subscriber\u2019s plan. More information about the duration of the various Validation Periods is available on your Affiliate dashboard on the Strikingly Website.\nDuring the Validation Period, Strikingly may investigate each Qualified Purchase for any Inappropriate Activity. Any breach of this Agreement by the Affiliate is grounds for Strikingly\u2019s denial of payment of Referral Fees.\nIf Strikingly determines, in its sole discretion, that there may be some other basis for denial, then Strikingly will delay payment of the Referral Fee until Strikingly determines that the referral is valid and the corresponding fee should be approved, or that there was some Inappropriate Activity and/or that the Referral Fee should be denied. In the event that Strikingly determines that there may be some basis for denial, or if Strikingly has any concerns about whether the Referral Fee should be approved, then Strikingly may ask for additional information regarding the transaction in question. Failure to provide this information promptly will cause any payment to be further delayed or, if the information is not timely provided, to be canceled.\nWithout excluding any of the other basis for denial, and with the caveat that Strikingly does not have to provide or state a basis for denial when denying Referral Fees, the following list is provided as a shorthand reminder to Affiliates of the types of conduct considered to be the sort of Inappropriate Activity that will generally result in the denial of Referral Fees:\nFraud or Other Misconduct\nFalse or Abusive Advertising\nTax Non-Compliance\nSelf-Invitations\nDouble Attributions\nCookie Stuffing\nKickbacks\nCancellations During the Trial or Validation Period\nBreach of This Agreement\nAdditionally, if an Affiliate refers an unusually large number or percentage of Premium Subscribers who dispute payments, it will be grounds for Strikingly to terminate this Agreement with the Affiliate for the cause.\nOnly after Strikingly has verified each Qualified Purchase will Referral Fees for such Qualified Purchase be credited to the Affiliate Dashboard.\nD. Payout of Referral Fees\nStrikingly pays Affiliate\u2019s Referral Fees upon request by the Affiliate only when the Affiliate is in good standing and has the Minimum Payment Amount accrued in Referral Fees. The current Minimum Payment Amount is displayed in the Affiliate Dashboard.\n(For example, if the Minimum Payment Amount is currently $25, and You have earned only $22 in Referral Fees, then You are not eligible to request payment; on the other hand, if you have earned $28 in Referral Fees, then you are able to request to be paid $25 to $28.)\nStrikingly will pay Your Referral Fee via the Payment Agent. In order to receive Your Referral Fee, You must have a valid account with the Payment Agent that is properly set up and in good standing.\nIf you have accrued the Minimum Payment Amount in your total Referral Fees, then you may request a Payout via the Affiliate Dashboard.\n1. Rates\nThe rates of the Referral Fees for a Qualified Purchase depend on the type of plan that the referred Premium Subscriber selects and on any promotions that Strikingly is running at that time. Due to the dynamic nature of rates and rate changes, please visit Your personalized Affiliate Dashboard on the Strikingly website to see Your current rates.\n2. Timing\nStrikingly will pay the accrued Referral Fees to the Affiliate within thirty (30) days of receiving a valid request for a Payout.\nE. Conditions of Payment\nAll payments of the Referral Fees will be due and payable in United States Dollars only, except as otherwise determined by Strikingly in its sole discretion. Payment will be made against a valid invoice issued by Affiliate, through its Payment Agent or any other method chosen by Strikingly, in its sole discretion. Affiliate is responsible to provide Strikingly with full and accurate details as required for it to remit the Referral Fees, and shall be solely liable for any delay in payment resulting from its failure to duly and timely provide Strikingly with such details.\nIn the event of any activity deemed suspicious by Strikingly at its sole determination, Strikingly may delay payment of the Referral Fees to Affiliate for up to sixty (60) days to verify the relevant transactions. In the event that Strikingly determines the activity to constitute fraud, it shall recalculate or withhold the Referral Fees accordingly and in its sole discretion. It is hereby clarified that in any event that Strikingly shall determine that Affiliate has acted in violation of this Agreement or is involved, directly or indirectly, in any fraudulent, deceptive, manipulative, or otherwise illegal activity connected to Strikingly, including without limitation to the Strikingly Site, Affiliate Links and/or Users, Strikingly shall have the right, in addition to any other right or remedy available to it under this Agreement or applicable law, to render the Affiliate Links assigned to such Affiliate inoperative, and immediately block Affiliate access to the Program, with no compensation to Affiliate. Affiliate hereby irrevocably waives any claim or demand against Strikingly, its directors, officers, shareholders, or employees in respect of such action taken by Strikingly.\nF. Taxes\nThe Affiliate is responsible for the payment of all taxes applicable to the conduct of the Affiliate\u2019s business. The payment to the Affiliate shall be subject to any withholding tax obligations applicable by law. It is agreed that the Referral Fees are inclusive of any and all taxes applicable by any law, including VAT (if applicable).\nG. Garnishment\nIf, for any reason, a Referral Fee is paid prior to discovering that fee should have been denied for one of the reasons provided above, then Strikingly will deduct an amount equal to the improperly paid fee from any future payments of fees to that Affiliate.\nH. Clawbacks of Referral Fees\nNotwithstanding any other provisions in this Agreement to the contrary, any incentive-based compensation, or any other compensation, paid to the Affiliate pursuant to this Agreement or any other agreement or arrangement with the Company or any related party, which is subject to recovery under any law, or government regulation, will be subject to such deductions and clawback as may be required to be made pursuant to such law, government regulation (or any policy adopted by the Company pursuant to any such law, government regulation).\nI. Changes to Referral Fees\nStrikingly may change the pricing, policies, and operating procedures at any time consistent with applicable laws. For example, Strikingly will determine the prices to be charged for services in accordance with Strikingly\u2019s own pricing policies. In the event that such changes affect items that Affiliate already has presented on the Affiliate Site, the Ads, or any other information provided by Affiliate to third parties in respect to this Agreement and its participation in the Program, Affiliate will be required to track such changes and reflect them in the Affiliate\u2019s Site or in any other relevant marketing means.\nJ. Non-Active Affiliates\nNon-Active Affiliates are not entitled to any fees or payments for recurring Referral Fees that would otherwise have accrued while being a Non-Active Affiliate.\n(For example, if You referred a new user who signed up as a Premium Subscriber for Strikingly\u2019s yearly plan on January 1, 2018, and then You took no further action as an Affiliate which led to Qualified Purchases, You will not be entitled to receive any Referral Fee if the new user you referred renews his annual plan for another year on January 1, 2019, because you will be a Non-Active Affiliate, and Non-Active Affiliates are not eligible to earn Referral Fees on returning customers.)\n1. No Payouts for Non-Active Affiliates\nNon-Active Affiliates may not request Payouts. If you are a Non-Active Affiliate and if you believe that you have earned Referral Fees for which you would otherwise be entitled to payment, you may either become an active Affiliate via Reactivation, or you may contact Strikingly directly and ask us to review your case and to make an expectation where we might, without thereby waiving any of our rights under this Agreement, may agree to make your fee payment despite your non-active status.\n2. Reactivation\nNon-Active Affiliates may be Reactivated by referring new Premium Subscribers who make a Qualified Purchase of Strikingly Services. Upon Reactivation, the Affiliate will once again be able to request payments (subject to the conditions listed above) and will once again receive Referral Fees for new subscribers and for any renewals of Premium Subscribers that Affiliate is credited for signing up after the Reactivation. To be clear, once an Affiliate becomes a Non-Active Affiliate, that Affiliate will not be entitled to receive any recurring Referral Fee fees for renewals of accounts that signed up prior to the Affiliate becoming a Non-Active Affiliate. All recurring Referral Fees that have not yet come due for renewals become forever null and void once an Affiliate becomes a Non-Active Affiliate.\nV. Affiliate Admission\nThis Section describes how You may be Admitted to and remain in the Program. No one shall be deemed an Affiliate unless and until the admission processes described in this section are completed.\nA. Applicant and Application\nTo begin the enrollment process, the Applicant must submit an Application. Applicant must provide full, true, and accurate information in the Application. Strikingly will evaluate the Application in good faith and may notify Applicant of acceptance or rejection within approximately thirty (30) business days. Unless Applicant receives a clear written notice from Strikingly confirming Applicant\u2019s admission in the Program, Applicant shall not be deemed to be part of the Program.\nB. Rejection\nStrikingly may reject any Application if Strikingly determines, in Strikingly\u2019s sole discretion, that the Affiliate Site or any Affiliate Activities is unsuitable for the Program for any reason. If Strikingly accepts Affiliate Application and thereafter the Affiliate Site or activity is determined (in Strikingly\u2019s sole discretion) to be unsuitable for the Program, Strikingly may terminate the Affiliate\u2019s participation in the Program at any time.\nUnsuitable Affiliate Sites or activities may include, but not be limited to, the Site Restrictions described above.\nStrikingly shall not be required to provide any explanation for its rejection of any prospective Affiliate.\nC. Age Restriction\nYou must be at least eighteen (18) years of age to join the Program. By submitting an Affiliate Application, You represent and warrant that You are at least eighteen (18) years of age and may legally agree to this agreement. The Company assumes no responsibility or liability for The misrepresentation of Your age.\nD. Identity Verification\nThe Company may require You to verify Your identity as a condition of Your enrollment into the Program. By submitting an Application, You represent and warrant that any identity information You provide is true, correct, and complete. The Company assumes no responsibility or liability for The misrepresentation of Your identity.\nE. Privacy Policy\nStrikingly\u2019s Privacy Policy is considered part of this Agreement. By executing this agreement, You acknowledge that You have read and accepted Strikingly\u2019s Privacy Policy.\nF. Reapplication\nRejection of an Application by Strikingly shall not derogate from the Affiliate\u2019s right to reapply to the Program at any other time thereafter, provided that the Affiliate complies with the provisions of this Agreement.\nG. Admission\nThe applicant shall be deemed Admitted and therefore be an Affiliate only when and if the Company has pronounced this in writing to the Applicant.\nVI. Affiliate Responsibilities (Affirmative Covenants)\nOnce the Affiliate is admitted, for the Affiliate to continue to comply with the requirements of the Program, Affiliate shall fulfill the responsibilities to the Company listed in this section. Any failure to fulfill these responsibilities may constitute a breach of this Agreement and may be grounds for dismissal from the Program and termination of this Agreement.\nA. Use Affiliate Links Properly\nTo permit accurate tracking, reporting, and Referral Fee accrual, Strikingly will provide Affiliate with a specific Affiliate Link, which is a unique hyperlink that identifies who directed a Visitor to the Strikingly website. Affiliate must ensure that each of the links between its Affiliate Site and the Strikingly Site properly utilizes the Affiliate Links provided to Affiliate. The affiliate may use Affiliate Links within Emails that the Affiliate sends to registered users of the Affiliate Site.\n1. Do Not Modify Affiliate Links\nAffiliate is not authorized to alter, modify or change any of the Affiliate Links. Affiliate will only earn payments in accordance with the Affiliate Dashboard, which is the Affiliate\u2019s user interface on the Strikingly Site where referrals, payments, and other key performance indicators and data about Affiliate activity are presented. Strikingly will not be held liable to the Affiliate with respect to any failure by the Affiliate to use such Affiliate Links. Strikingly will not be responsible for errors that may occur in the tracking of transactions if the Affiliate has made or caused any such modification to the Affiliate Link.\n2. No Other Uses of Affiliate Links\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the Affiliate will use the Affiliate Link only for the purposes of the Program. Any other use of the Affiliate Link will be considered void. Improper use of an Affiliate Link constitutes a material and total breach of this Agreement.\nB. Use Strikingly Marks Properly\nFrom time to time, Strikingly may provide Affiliates with an Ad that contains Strikingly Mark(s). When this occurs, Strikingly grants to Affiliate a License to use these Strikingly Mark(s) for the sole purpose of obtaining Qualified Purchasers pursuant to this Agreement. The affiliate may not use any of the Strikingly Marks in any manner other than as contained in the Ads. Furthermore, the Affiliate may not modify any of the Ads in any way, whatsoever unless approved in advance and in writing by Strikingly. The License shall expire upon the expiration or termination of the Affiliation Term.\n1. Use Ads in Good Taste\nAffiliate shall display the Ads in good taste, adjacent to any with the first or most prominent use of such Ads in a piece of advertising means, in which such Ads appear, subject to other requirements as Strikingly may from time to time impose and provide to Affiliate, including Strikingly trademark guidelines. The affiliate may not use the Ads, and the Strikingly Marks contained therewith in a manner that, in Strikingly\u2019s sole discretion, is disparaging or otherwise portrays Strikingly in a negative light. Affiliate shall have no other right, title, or interest in or to the Ads and Strikingly Marks contained therewith other than as specified in the limited License granted herein.\n2. Treat Strikingly as the Owner of Strikingly Marks\nAs between Affiliate and Strikingly, Strikingly shall own all rights, title, and interest, including all intellectual property rights, in and to the Strikingly Site, the Program, and Strikingly Marks. Strikingly may at any time, without prior notice, require the Affiliate to remove or modify the Ads, or dynamically replace the Strikingly creative or text with creative or text suitable to Strikingly in Strikingly\u2019s sole discretion.\n3. Disclose Affiliate Participation\nAffiliate shall include in its Affiliate Site, in its Affiliate Emails, and in any other means by which Affiliate is promoting Strikingly, a disclosure conveying that Affiliate participates in Affiliation programs which may reward Affiliate with monetary compensation in connection with the referral of Visitors to advertisers and other third parties. Such disclosure must be in a prominent and easily accessible place and shall be in compliance with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations.\nVII. Affiliate Prohibitions (Negative Covenants)\nOnce accepted to the Program, Affiliate hereby agrees not to do anything or take any action that may harm Strikingly. In particular, Affiliates are prohibited from taking inappropriate actions listed in this section; however, this is not meant to be an exclusive list, and other actions which are not specifically contemplated here but which are harmful to the Company or its interests are likewise prohibited.\nA. No Violation of Laws\nWhile it is important for Affiliates to comply with all laws, this Agreement cannot possibly detail all the legal obligations that Affiliates must obey. However, the Company identified the following Marketing Laws as especially important for Affiliates to understand and obey, especially Privacy Laws.\nB. Market Responsibly and Compliantly\nIf Affiliate sends or causes to be sent, any electronic messages in connection with this Agreement and/or the Affiliate Program, then Affiliate agrees, acknowledges, represents, and warrants that all such messages shall be in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations regarding the use of electronic messages, including Marketing Laws, Privacy Laws, and any other similar laws pronounced by any authority in a jurisdiction that may assert authority over that message.\nC. DO NOT SPAM\nStrikingly expressly forbids Affiliates from sending Spam. You cannot use Spam when You are promoting Strikingly. Prohibited SPAM includes, but is not limited to:\nsending, initiating, or procuring the sending of an Email to any person who has either not explicitly requested to receive such messages (or has explicitly requested to receive no further Emails) specifically from Affiliate, including without limitation for the purposes of sending unsolicited bulk email, executing any \u201cmass mailings\u201d or \u201cemail blasts,\u201d or for the purpose of spamming any public forum, including without limitation, any blog, message board, classified listings, auction sites, altnet, newsnet, newsgroups, or similar services;\nemploying any false or deceptive information regarding Affiliate\u2019s identity, or regarding the intent, subject, or origin of the message or failing to include accurate information regarding the Affiliate\u2019s identity, and the intent, subject, and origin of the Email;\nexploiting documented or undocumented security holes on any client or server machine;\nfailing to (i) include clear, valid, and conspicuously displayed \u201cFrom\u201d and \u201cSubject\u201d lines in the Email, (ii) include a functioning return address (or hyperlink) in the Email that enables the recipient to submit an Opt-Out Request for no less than thirty (30) days from the date the Email was sent; or (iii) honor any Opt-Out Request within ten (10) days of receipt of such Opt-out request by Affiliate;\nobtaining Email addresses via automated means or sending any Email to any address which was obtained via automated means, including via the automated combination of names, letters, or numbers, dictionary attacks, or the use of spyware, viruses, or other means of bypassing system security or invading consumer privacy;\nemploying any fraudulent, deceptive, false, or misleading information in connection with the Emails; or\nsending any commercial marketing Email or promotion to, or collecting any personally identifiable information from, any person who is under eighteen (18) years of age.\nThese are just examples of Spam, not an exhaustive list. Use judgment in sending electronic messages to avoid sending anything that could be labeled as Spam.\nD. No Phone or Text Solicitation\nYou may not solicit users to Strikingly services by calling people on the phone or sending text messages to cell phone numbers, regardless of whether You use an auto-dialer. Phone and text solicitations are expressly forbidden.\nE. No Privacy Violations\nAffiliates must comply with all Privacy Laws when handling protected information. Affiliates are independently responsible for ensuring their own compliance with all laws, including Privacy Laws. You agree to indemnify, defend and hold Strikingly harmless for any of Your violations or alleged violations of any Privacy Laws.\nAs a precondition to becoming an Affiliate, You must read, understand, and agree to the Strikingly Privacy Policy. To maintain Your status as an Affiliate You must also read, understand, and agree to any modifications to the Privacy Policy. If You disagree with the Privacy Policy in any way at any time, You must notify the company in writing that You want to terminate this Affiliate Agreement; otherwise, the version of the Privacy Policy that is currently adopted by the Company will govern Your rights under Privacy Laws. In addition, You must consent to use Affiliate Links appropriately and as permitted by this Agreement.\nF. No Usurpation of Strikingly Marks\nAn Affiliate may not pretend that it is Strikingly or otherwise misdirect traffic to any Affiliate Site. This includes a prohibition of the following activities:\nUsing, procuring, bidding on, or otherwise arranging for an advertisement displayed on a search engine\u2019s results page after a user performs a keyword search that uses or includes any of the Strikingly Marks;\nPurchasing any domain name that includes any Strikingly Marks; and\nAccumulating, amassing, squatting, hoarding, stockpiling, investing in, selling, laundering, or otherwise obtaining or holding any domains that might appear to be Strikingly Marks or to otherwise belong to Strikingly.\nIn general, you may not do anything that could cause confusion between You and the Company.\nG. Other Prohibited Activity\nWhile it is impossible to discuss every prohibited activity, and while doing so is not necessary because Affiliates owe Strikingly a duty of good faith and fair dealing that prohibits any wrongful conduct that is not in the spirit of this agreement, the following list of prohibited activities are examples of behavior that is de facto and presumptively wrongful. These behaviors and all similar and otherwise wrongful behaviors are prohibited by this Agreement and will constitute a breach of this Agreement and be grounds for termination from this Program.\nNo Purchased Links. The affiliate may not purchase direct ads that contain an Affiliate Link or any link that directly leads to Strikingly Site. The affiliate may not purchase direct ads that contain any Strikingly Marks. Affiliate Links may be placed only on websites or content that an Affiliate owns or creates.\nNo Kickbacks.

Affiliate is prohibited from making inaccurate, deceptive, or otherwise misleading claims about Strikingly and the Strikingly services.\nNo Deceptive Practices. Affiliate shall not engage in any practice that generates traffic to the Affiliate Link through illegal, false, deceptive, or bad faith practices, or engage in any effort to deceive or defraud the Company or potential new users, regardless of whether or not such practice actually causes harm to Strikingly.\nNo Sowing Confusion.

No Exclusive Dealing\nThis Agreement does not obligate Strikingly or any of its related parties to deal exclusively with Affiliate or any of its related parties. Strikingly maintains the right to compete with the Affiliate and any of the Affiliate\u2019s related parties to the extent permissible under applicable law.\nF. No Employment Relationship\nThe affiliate is an independent contractor and not an employee of Strikingly. Affiliates agree to indemnify and hold harmless Strikingly from any liability that may result from Affiliate claiming to be or acting as if Affiliate is anything other than an independent contractor of Strikingly.\nX. Strikingly\u2019s Limitations of Liability\nUnder no circumstances shall Strikingly, its subsidiaries, officers, directors, employees, or suppliers be held liable for any direct or indirect damages and/or losses, to the Affiliate, user, and/or other third parties that may arise due to (i) \u201cdowntime\u201d and/or availability of Strikingly site or the program, and any losses of any kind that may result due to downtime in the program and/or any other third party\u2019s down time; (ii) any termination of this agreement; (iii) any investments, actual or planned, by the affiliate in connection with its participation in the affiliates program.\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this agreement, Strikingly, its subsidiaries, officers, directors, employees, or suppliers will not be liable to Affiliate with respect to any subject matter of this agreement under any contract, negligence, tort, strict liability, or other legal or equitable theory for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, punitive or exemplary damages (including, without limitation, loss of goodwill or actual or anticipated revenue, profits or lost business), even if Strikingly, its subsidiaries, officers, directors, employees or suppliers have been advised of the possibility of such damages. Our aggregate liability arising in connection with this agreement and the program will not exceed the total fees paid or payable to the Affiliate under this agreement in the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the date on which the event giving rise to the most recent claim of liability occurred.\nXI. Modification of this Agreement\nStrikingly may modify any of the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement, at any time and in its sole discretion by providing Affiliate fourteen (14) days prior notice of such modification. Notice of any change by Email, to Affiliate\u2019s address as provided to Strikingly, or the posting on a Strikingly Site of a change notice or a new agreement, is considered sufficient notice to Affiliate of a modification to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Modifications may include but are not limited to, changes in the scope of available Referral Fees, payment procedures and schedules, and Affiliation Program rules.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the Referral Fees Plan may be altered, modified, or changed by Strikingly, from time to time, in its sole and absolute discretion, provided that Strikingly will notify Affiliate of such change of the Referral Fees Plan. Referral Fees earned prior to such change will be paid according to the conditions in effect prior to such changes. Referral Fees earned after such change is in effect will be paid according to the new conditions of the amended Referral Fees Plan\u2019s effective date at which the payment has been made.\nIf any modification is unacceptable to Affiliate, Affiliate\u2019s sole recourse shall be to terminate this Agreement. Affiliate\u2019s continued participation in the Program following the posting of a change notice or a new agreement on a Strikingly Site will constitute binding acceptance of such change.\nXII. Termination of this Agreement\nThis Agreement will continue in effect until (i) it is terminated by notice of either of the parties, (ii) Affiliate breaches this agreement, (iii) the term of this agreement expires, or (iv) this Agreement is terminated by an act of law or government body.\nUpon the termination of the Affiliation Term for any reason, the Affiliate shall promptly remove all Affiliate Links, Ads, and other Program-related content from Affiliate Site or any other communication means used by the Affiliate. Affiliate will immediately cease use of, and remove from Affiliate Site, all links to Strikingly Site, all of Strikingly Marks, and all other materials provided by or on behalf of Strikingly to the Affiliate pursuant hereto or in connection with the Program.\nAny terms or provisions of this Agreement that, by their express terms do, or by their nature should survive termination of the Affiliation Term, shall continue to be in force despite the termination of the Affiliation Term.\nA. Termination at Will\nThe term of the Affiliate\u2019s participation in the Program shall commence upon Strikingly\u2019s acceptance of the Affiliate Application and shall end upon the provision of a termination notice by either party in accordance with the provisions of this Section.\nEither party may terminate this Agreement as for its own participation in the Program at any time, with or without cause, by giving the other party ten (10) days prior written notice of termination.\nTermination of the Agreement will result in the deactivation or deletion of the Affiliate\u2019s account or its access to the Affiliate account in the Strikingly Site, and the forfeiture and relinquishment of all potential or to-be-paid Referral Fees in the Affiliate\u2019s account. For the avoidance of doubt, Strikingly will not pay Referral Fees to any Affiliate after that Affiliate\u2019s termination, even if that Affiliate otherwise accrued Referral Fees that were owed and unpaid. Such fees will be canceled upon termination of this Agreement.\nExcept as stated otherwise, upon the termination of this Agreement, the Affiliate will be entitled to receive Referral Fees for Premium Subscribers accrued during the Affiliation Term.\nB. Termination for Cause\nWhile any breach by Affiliate of this agreement is grounds for Strikingly to terminate this Agreement immediately, four (4) circumstances, in particular, may arise that will result in Strikingly immediately terminating this Affiliate Agreement with You. In the event of a material breach of this Agreement by Affiliate, Strikingly may, at its sole and absolute discretion, terminate the Affiliation Term immediately, without prior notification, and the Affiliate will not be entitled to receive any unpaid Referral Fees, regardless of whether or not such fees accrued prior to such termination.\n1. Fraud\nIf an Affiliate attempts any of the methods forbidden in this Agreement or any other methods that could reasonably be construed as fraud, Strikingly will terminate this Affiliate Agreement with regard to the Affiliate who is committing any type of fraud or scam.\n2. Disputes\nIf an Affiliate files an unreasonable number of disputes with Strikingly, or if new users referred to Strikingly by an Affiliate tend to file disputes at an unusually high rate, Strikingly will terminate this Affiliate Agreement with regard to the Affiliate who is causing or related to such disputes.\n3. Refunds\nIf users referred to by an Affiliate demand refunds or made fraudulent purchases at an unusually high rate, Strikingly will terminate this Affiliate Agreement with regard to the Affiliate who referred such users.\n4. SPAM\nThe Company has a zero-tolerance policy against Spam. Any Affiliate who sends Spam will be terminated immediately.\nXIII. Dispute Resolution\nAffiliate acknowledges and agrees that any disputes between Affiliate and Company shall first be resolved through internal negotiations. The Affiliate must first contact the company to seek a mutually agreeable resolution to any concerns. If that does not result in the Affiliate\u2019s satisfaction, the Affiliate shall enter into mediation regarding the dispute. If mediation does not result in an amicable resolution, then the Affiliate must then bring the claim to arbitration, as more fully set forth below. Affiliate has waived any and all rights to file a lawsuit in a court with regard to any matters set forth in this Affiliate Agreement.\nA. Negotiation\nStrikingly aims to ensure that Affiliates are satisfied with their relationship with Strikingly, and we hope to resolve any concerns quickly and amicably. If Affiliate has any concerns about this Agreement, the Affiliate should first email affiliates@strikingly.com. The company tries to respond to concerns as promptly as practicable and to resolve them through direct discussions.\nB. Mediation\nIf a dispute arises from or relates to this contract or the breach thereof, and if the dispute cannot be settled through direct discussions, Affiliates agrees to endeavor first to settle the dispute by mediation administered by the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d) under its Commercial Mediation Procedures before resorting to arbitration.\nC. Arbitration Procedures\nAffiliate further agrees that any unresolved controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this contract, or the breach thereof, shall be settled by arbitration administered by the AAA in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The place of arbitration shall be San Francisco, California. The arbitration shall be governed by the laws of the State of California. If the dispute is less than $5,000 there shall be no discovery other than the exchange of documents. \u00a0If the dispute is over $5,000, discovery shall consist of no more than 3 depositions of 3 hours or less. In making determinations regarding the scope of the exchange of electronic information, the arbitrator(s) and the parties agree to be guided by The Sedona Principles, Third Edition: Best Practices, Recommendations & Principles for Addressing Electronic Document Production. The arbitration will be based on the submission of documents and there shall be no in-person or oral hearing. The award shall be made within 3 months of the filing of the notice of intention to arbitrate (demand), and the arbitrator(s) shall agree to comply with this schedule before accepting an appointment. However, this time limit may be extended by the arbitrator for good cause shown, or by mutual agreement of the parties. The arbitrators will have no authority to award punitive or other damages not measured by the prevailing party's actual damages, except as may be required by statute. The arbitrator(s) shall not award consequential damages in any arbitration initiated under this section.\nD. Confidentiality of Arbitration\nExcept as may be required by law, neither a party nor an arbitrator may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of both parties.\nE. Costs of Arbitration\nEach party shall bear its own costs and expenses and an equal share of the arbitrators' and administrative fees of arbitration. The parties agree that failure or refusal of a party to pay its required share of the deposits for arbitrator compensation or administrative charges shall constitute a waiver by that party to present evidence or cross-examine witnesses. \u00a0In such event, the other party shall be required to present evidence and legal argument as the arbitrator(s) may require for the making of an award. \u00a0Such waiver shall not allow for a default judgment against the non-paying party in the absence of evidence presented as provided above.\nF. No Right to Jury Trial\nYou hereby waive any rights to trial by jury in any action or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the transactions relating to its subject matter.\nG. Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief\nYou agree that You may bring claims against Strikingly only on an individual basis and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, representative, or private attorney general action or proceeding. Unless both You and Strikingly agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate or join more than one person's or party's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a consolidated, representative, class, or private attorney general action or proceeding. Also, the arbitrator may award relief (including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief) only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief necessitated by that party's individual claim(s). Any relief awarded cannot affect other users. If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this Section\u2019s limitations as to a particular claim or a particular request for a remedy (such as a request for injunctive relief), then that claim or that remedy request (and only that claim or that remedy request) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court, subject to Your and Strikingly\u2019s right to appeal the court's decision. All other claims will be arbitrated.\nXIV. Confidentiality\nStrikingly may disclose to Affiliate certain information as a result of Affiliate\u2019s participation in the Program, which information we consider to be confidential. For purposes of this Agreement, the term \u201cConfidential Information\u201d shall include, but not be limited to (i) any modifications to the terms and provisions of the Program made specifically for the Affiliate or Affiliate Site and not generally available to other affiliates of the Program; (ii) price guidelines, future service releases, trade secrets, know-how, inventions, processes, programs, schematics, data, pricing, and discount schedules, customer lists, financial information, and sales and marketing plans relating to Strikingly or Strikingly\u2019s services. Confidential Information shall also include any information that Strikingly designates as confidential during the term of this Agreement. Confidential Information shall not include information which is: (a) previously known to the other party without an obligation of confidence or without breach of this Agreement; (b) which is publicly disclosed (other than by the Affiliate) either prior or subsequent to the Affiliate\u2019s receipt of such information; or (c) required to be disclosed by the other party by law or by the order of a court or similar judicial or administrative body.\nAffiliate shall at all times, both during the Term and at all times thereafter, keep and hold such Confidential Information in the strictest confidence, and shall not use such Confidential Information for any purpose other than as may be reasonably necessary for the performance of its duties pursuant to this Agreement, without Strikingly\u2019s prior written consent.\nXV. Miscellaneous Provisions\nThe headings herein are inserted as a matter of convenience only and do not define, limit, or describe the scope of this Agreement or the intent of the provisions hereof.\nA. No Waiver\nThe failure of each of the parties to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the conditions and terms of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Strikingly\u2019s failure to enforce Affiliate\u2019s strict performance of any provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of Strikingly\u2019s right to subsequently enforce such provision or any other provision of this Agreement.\nB. Entire Agreement\nThis Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between the parties regarding the specific subject matter covered herein. This Agreement supersedes any and all prior written or verbal contracts or understandings between the parties hereto and neither party shall be bound by any statements or representations made by either party not embodied in this Agreement.\nC. No Oral Modification\nYou may not amend or waive any provision of this Agreement unless in writing and signed by both parties.\nD. Compliance with Law and Regulations; No conflict.\nAffiliate shall comply with any and all applicable laws, regulations (including without limitation the Federal Trade Commission Endorsement Guides), and statutes of the United States or any other state, country, or jurisdiction in which Affiliate acts, including without limitation, such that relate to advertising, dissemination of email, and/or electronic communications. It is the Affiliate\u2019s responsibility to be aware of all such regulations, statutes, and laws.\nE. Choice of Law\nIf any dispute arises in connection with the performance of this Agreement and cannot be amicably resolved, such dispute shall be solely and finally governed by and be construed according to the laws of the state of Delaware, without regard to the conflict of laws provisions thereto. Any dispute arising under or in relation to this Agreement shall be exclusively resolved in the competent courts of Dover, Delaware.\nF. No Assignment\nNeither party may assign its rights or obligations under this Agreement to any party, except to a party who obtains all or substantially all of the business or assets of a third party.\nG. Notice\nFor purposes of this Agreement, any notice or other communication to the Company must be in writing. Such notice shall be deemed received (1) on the date receipt is acknowledged by Company; (2) five business days after such notice is sent via domestic registered or certified mail, with postage and charges prepaid; or (3) one business day after dispatch by a recognized next-day courier service; provided that such notice is properly addressed to Company at its address as set forth below:\nStrikingly, Inc.Attn: Affiliate Program548 Market St, PMB 69246San Francisco, California 94104-5401, USA\nAny notice or other communication to Affiliate may be in writing or electronic. Electronic notice to Affiliate shall be deemed received on the date which the email is sent; written notice to Affiliate shall be deemed received (1) on the date receipt is acknowledged by Affiliate; (2) five business days after such notice is sent via domestic registered or certified mail, with postage and charges prepaid; or (3) one business day after dispatch by a recognized next-day courier service; provided that such notice is properly addressed to Affiliate as provided in that Affiliate\u2019s Application.\nH. Headings\nThe headings and titles contained in this Agreement are included for convenience only, and shall not limit or otherwise affect the terms of this Agreement.\nI. Explanations and Summaries\nAny explanation or summary of the terms presented hereto are provided for convenience only, and shall not limit or otherwise affect the terms of this agreement.\nJ. Severability\nIf any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent necessary such that the intent of the parties is effectuated, and the remainder of this Agreement shall have full force and effect.\n* * * * *\nWas this article helpful?\n2 out of 3 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

After activating, form responses from your Strikingly site will be automatically added to your MailChimp list. Find this option under \u201cAdvanced\u201d settings in your form.\nNote: This is only available for Pro users and up.\nWhat forms are applicable?\nYou can connect to external services like Mailchimp in the following form sections:\nSign-Up Form\nContact Form\nCustom Form\nWhen you edit the form, you'll see the entry point in the form settings:\nFor custom forms, you can find this setting in the \"Advanced\" tab:\nHow MailChimp connection works\nStep 1: Click \"Connect your account\" in Connect External Services.\nStep 2: Log into MailChimp.\nStep 3: Select a MailChimp audience for form submissions.\nStep 4: Republish your site to make this live!

Now 3 types of form fields will be mapped to MailChimp contact info as follows:\nName \u2192 First Name\nEmail \u2192 Email Address\nPhone \u2192 Phone Number\n2. If your form is missing the \"Email\" field, form submissions will be dropped by MailChimp. Please make sure your form is set up with at least one \"Email\" form field.\n3. In your MailChimp audience settings, if any fields other than \"Email\" are checked as required, your form submissions may be dropped by MailChimp. To resolve this issue, please uncheck other fields as Required in your MailChimp list settings.\n4. New form submissions from your Strikingly site will create a new contact in your selected MailChimp list. New form submissions can't be used to update existing MailChimp contacts.\n5. If you're using Strikingly's Custom Form, the first \"Short Text\" field will be used as the \"Name\" field in MailChimp audience information.\n6. If your Strikingly form has more than one \"Email\" field type, only the first email field from Strikingly will be used as the audience email field in MailChimp.\nWas this article helpful?\n3 out of 3 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

If you can\u2019t find what you are looking for, feel free to chat with us!\nWhat is Strikingly?\nStrikingly is the most loved website and e-commerce builder by entrepreneurs. We\u2019ve launched 12+ million websites & online stores \u2014 and counting! Strikingly was born in Silicon Valley, backed by Y Combinator & investors of Google and Facebook. We\u2019ve been featured on Forbes, New York Times, USA Today, and many more media outlets. Strikingly is known for two things: being ridiculously easy to use and having the best customer support. Building a website or storefront with Strikingly is as easy as making a slideshow or Powerpoint presentation. Simply put, \u201cStrikingly is actually striking\u201d. This quote from our user says it all!\nWhat is the Strikingly Affiliate Program?\nTo date, we\u2019ve paid millions of dollars to over 6,000 affiliates around the world. The Strikingly Affiliate Program allows you to earn recurring commissions by referring subscribers to our premium plans. When you sign up for our affiliate program, you'll get a unique referral link to place on your website, blog, or channel. When someone becomes a paid subscriber through your unique referral link, we will pay you up to $1032 for one sale, plus recurring commissions for the entire lifetime of that subscriber!\nHow much can I earn?\nOur commission rate is among the most generous in the world among affiliate programs.\nUp to $1032 for one sale\n50% of any subscription fee users pay in their 1st year of signup\n20% of any recurring subscription fee users pay after the 1st year, as long as you remain an active affiliate\nNo cap on how much you can earn\nWe\u2019ve seen many affiliates grow from 0 to tens of thousands of dollars in earnings. Join them today!\nWhy should I refer to Strikingly now?\nThree words: Join. The. Revolution.\nThere are 582 million entrepreneurs in the world, and nearly 30% of Americans are self-employed. All these startups, entrepreneurs, and small businesses need websites or blogs, or online stores. The market is huge and expanding every day.\nE-commerce is exploding. E-commerce revenue has reached $4.28 trillion, and there are currently 7.9 million e-commerce stores in the world. These numbers are predicted to rise exponentially in the years to come.\nCovid has sped up the launching and buying of anything online. In the UK alone, there was an 87% increase in online buying. It is predicted that by 2023, US e-commerce revenue will grow over 70%. Many people are flooding to build their sites to capture this wave now.\nThe uprising No-code builder market is expected to grow 23% in 2021 alone. As technology is not as scary anymore, many more people with zero coding or design experience will be launching their websites and online stores.\nThe above mega-trends have led to more than 100% growth of online stores built on Strikingly since Covid started. The acceleration of launching and buying online doesn\u2019t seem to be stopping any time soon.\nYou don\u2019t want to miss out, right?\nWhy do people love Strikingly?\nThere are two key reasons:\nRidiculously Easy to Use.\u00a0 Building a website with Strikingly is like building a slideshow, literally. If you have used Powerpoint or Keynote in the past, then you're more than capable of publishing a website with Strikingly.

We enforce these guidelines in order to ensure high email deliverability and to ensure your emails are not marked as spam in your recipients\u2019 inboxes!\nNote: These requirements apply to all emails you send from Strikingly, including newsletters, individual audience emails, and automatic email notifications sent to your audience.\nRequirements:\nWe automatically add an unsubscribe link in the footer of every email from Strikingly --- you don\u2019t have to do anything. If a recipient unsubscribes, they will no longer receive the relevant email. (Emails without an unsubscribe link are more likely to be marked as spam.)\nWe add a permission reminder in the footer of every email. This reminds recipients why they\u2019re receiving this email and which website this email is coming from, in case they mistakenly believe your email is spam. You can edit the permission reminder to fit your own situation. If you manually add email recipients (contacts that did not fill out a form on your website), make sure you do not email those users unless you\u2019ve received the recipients' consent.\nEvery email must include a valid physical address to reach you. Please add your physical address in Email Notifications in the site editor, and we'll insert this address into all the emails you send.\nDon't use illegal or suspicious words in your email. Strikingly has a filter to detect spam content and your emails may be blocked if they trigger it.\nIn the Email Notification settings, you may set an email address in the \u201cFrom Email\u201d field to specify the address shown in your recipients\u2019 inbox. This email address must be a real one that you own. (When you set a new \u201cFrom Email,\u201d you will be asked to verify your ownership with a code.)\nPlease observe any additional anti-spam laws that apply to you and your jurisdiction.\nInternational Requirements By Country\nEmail regulations vary by country, so you may be subject to additional regulations depending on both the location of your business and your contacts. It's your responsibility to ensure that you comply with the latest requirements that apply to you. For your convenience, here are some links to the anti-spam regulations of different countries.\nAustralia Spam Act 2003\nCanada's Anti-Spam Legislation\nChina Regulations on Internet Email Services\nFrance CNIL Guidelines on email marketing\nGermany Gesetz gegen den unlauteren Wettbewerb (UWG)\nJapan The Law on Regulation of Transmission of Specified Electronic Mail\nNetherlands Dutch Telecommunications Act\nSpain Act 34/2002 of 11 July on Information Society Services and Electronic Commerce\nSweden Marknadsf\u00f6ringslag (1995:450)\nUK Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003\nUS CAN-SPAM Act\nWas this article helpful?\n0 out of 0 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

If Affiliate automates its Affiliate PPC Campaigns, Affiliate is solely responsible for complying with the foregoing. Strikingly\u00a0recommends you add the Strikingly\u00a0Marks as negative keywords in your Affiliate PPC Campaigns.\n9. Affiliate Materials\n9.1 Endorsement Rules. Affiliate Materials must comply with all Applicable Laws concerning endorsements. Affiliate Materials must reflect Affiliate\u2019s honest opinions, findings, beliefs, or experiences with Strikingly\u00a0and the Strikingly\u00a0Platform, and may not contain any statements or representations about Strikingly\u00a0or the Strikingly\u00a0Platform that are not true or are deceptive. If Affiliate\u2019s opinions, findings, or experiences included in the Affiliate Materials change, Affiliate will promptly inform Strikingly\u00a0of such change and if possible, promptly update the applicable Affiliate Materials.\n9.2 Disclosure of Sponsorship. Affiliate Materials must comply with all Applicable Laws concerning sponsored content. Affiliates must include a disclosure statement within any and all Affiliate Materials (including, without limitation, all pages, blog posts, social media posts, or emails) where Links or Offer Codes are posted as an endorsement or review, and where it is not clear that such Link or Offer Code is a paid advertisement. Such statements should be clear and concise and inform readers that you are being compensated for your review or endorsement. If you receive the Strikingly product for free, you must also clearly state this in your disclosure. Disclosures: (a) must be made at the beginning of the claims and may not appear solely in a \u201cTerms of Use\u201d, \u201cLegal\u201d, \u201cAbout Us\u201d or other separate pages on an Affiliate Site; (b) should be placed above the fold and should not require scrolling to be read; and (c) should be made in the same medium as the endorsement or review (e.g. video, text). Pop-up, hover state, and button disclosures are not permitted. These disclosure guidelines apply to social media platforms even where space is restricted (e.g., tweets). For more information about FTC disclosure requirements, please review the FTC's \"Dot Com Disclosures\" Guidelines at http://www.ftc.gov/os/2013/03/130312dotcomdisclosures.pdf\u00a0(example 21) and the FTC's Endorsement Guidelines at http://business.ftc.gov/advertising-and-marketing/endorsements If you engage in so-called \u201cnative advertising\u201d, you further agree to comply with the FTC\u2019s Enforcement Policy Statement on Deceptively Formatted Advertisements at https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_statements/896923/151222deceptiveenforcement.pdf\u00a0and\u00a0related guidelines.\n9.3.

Affiliate may use and publish the Strikingly\u00a0Materials solely in the form provided by Strikingly\u00a0solely as specifically approved by Strikingly. Affiliate shall not and shall not cause or permit any third party (including, without limitation, any sub-affiliates) to:\nregister any domain names which include the Strikingly Marks;\ncreate or publish any Affiliate Sites (or pages or posts therein) which in any way copy, resemble, or mirror the look and feel of the StrikinglySite;\nuse any means to create the impression that Affiliate Sites are the StrikinglySite or any part of the Strikingly\u00a0Site, including, without limitation, framing of the Strikingly\u00a0Site in any manner;\nengage in cookie stuffing or include pop-ups, false or misleading links on Affiliate Sites;\nmask, obscure, or otherwise deidentify the referring URL information (i.e. the page from where a click originates);\nuse redirects to hide or manipulate the original source;\nuse redirects to bounce a click off of a domain from which the click did not originate in order to give the appearance that it came from such domain;\nintersperse any content or enable any additional pop-up between a Link and the StrikinglySite;\ndirectly or indirectly access, launch, and/or activate Links through or from, or otherwise incorporate Links in, any software application, website, or other means except as expressly authorized by Strikingly;\n\u201ccrawl\u201d, \u201cspider\u201d, index, or in any non-transitory manner store or cache information obtained from any Links, or any part, copy, or derivative thereto;\nengage in any action or practice that reflects poorly on Strikingly, or otherwise disparages or devalues Strikingly\u2019s or its customers\u2019 reputation or goodwill; or\nreverse engineer, recompile, or reverse assemble the Strikingly\n10.3 Communications. Affiliate will communicate regularly with Strikingly\u00a0or its marketing agency and will respond to any requests from Strikingly\u00a0or its marketing agency for clarification or more information on any subscriptions or clicks which Strikingly\u00a0suspects may be in violation of these Master Terms in a timely and honest manner. Affiliate agrees: (a) to be forthcoming and honest, and not intentionally vague or otherwise misleading or deceitful; (b) to respond to all requests within a reasonable time period; and (c) to retain documentation and records sufficient to enable Affiliate to substantiate or validate the source of any traffic with clear and demonstrable proof.\n11. Commissions\n11.1 Attributable Subscribers. An \u201cAttributable Subscriber\u201d shall be any subscriber to a Strikingly\u00a0plan category (\u201cPlan Category\u201d) who: (i) arrives on the Strikingly\u00a0Site via a Link (the date of such arrival, the \u201cLanding Date\u201d); (ii) has not visited the Strikingly\u00a0Site after the Landing Date from any source (including, without limitation, any other affiliates in the Program) other than Affiliate Sites; (iii) becomes a subscriber (\u201cPayment\u201d) within thirty (30) days after the Landing Date (the date of such subscription action in Eastern Standard Time, the \u201cLink Start Date\u201d); and (iv) remains in good standing as a Strikingly\u00a0subscriber over the Attributable Period. The Attributable Period varies according to the time duration prescribed by the Plan Category: 10 days after Payment for Monthly Plan, 60 days after Payment for Yearly Plan, and 120 days after Payment for 2-Year or above.\n11.2 Commissions. Affiliate shall be paid commissions for Attributable Subscribers by Strikingly in accordance with the following payment terms: Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Strikingly when an Attributable Subscriber\u00a0is referred by an Affiliate to a Plan Category, Affiliate\u00a0will receive a fixed one-time Commission\u00a0of thirty\u00a0percent (30%) of the first payment\u00a0received from such Attributable Subscriber. Any Commission payable to an Affiliate will be paid via Paypal in USD the on the 1st of each month, subject to the other terms of this Agreement. In the event the 1st of each month falls on a holiday, Commission payments will be paid on the business day following the holiday.\n11.3 If you breach the Agreement or otherwise engage in any behavior which Strikingly deems improper, in each case as determined by Strikingly in its sole discretion, you will not receive any Commissions. Strikingly reserves the absolute right, which it may exercise at any time for any reason, without any liability to you, to cancel, reduce or reverse Commissions, modify the payment terms, or suspend you from the Program.\n11.4 Non-Qualifying Subscribers. Affiliate acknowledges that no Commissions will be paid to Affiliate for: (a) any subscribers who Strikingly is unable to attribute to Affiliate; (b) a subscriber via a Link who visited the Strikingly Site prior to the Landing Date from a source other than Affiliate Sites; or (c) any subscribers who otherwise do not qualify as an Attributable Subscriber.\n11.5 Taxes. Affiliate may charge and Strikingly shall pay applicable national, state, or local sales and use, value-added or goods and services taxes that Affiliate is legally obligated to charge (\u201cIndirect Taxes\u201d), provided that such Indirect Taxes are separately stated on the invoice that Affiliate provides to Strikingly and that such invoices otherwise meet the requirements for a valid tax invoice in accordance with applicable law. If you have questions about configuring your Platform profile to charge Indirect Taxes, please contact Impact. If you do not configure your Platform profile to charge Indirect Taxes to Strikingly prior to receiving any payment to which such Indirect Taxes apply under the Agreement, you will indemnify and hold harmless the Strikingly Indemnitees (as defined below) from and against any and all claims, demands, judgments, liabilities, losses, and causes of action of any Governmental Authority, and any costs (including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees) arising out of your failure to charge Indirect Taxes or otherwise comply with Applicable Laws. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, Affiliate may not charge and Strikingly will not be liable for any income taxes imposed on Affiliate or any other taxes or charges assessed against Affiliate or associated with the operation of Affiliate\u2019s business. Taxes may be deducted or withheld from any payments made to Affiliate hereunder as required by Applicable Laws, and payment to Affiliate as reduced by such deductions or withholdings will constitute full payment and settlement to Affiliate of such payment. Prior to the Affiliate receiving any payments hereunder, the Affiliate will upload all required tax documentation to the Platform. Additionally, the Affiliate will provide Strikingly with any forms, documents, or certifications as Strikingly may reasonably request. Any Affiliate located outside of the United States certifies that it will perform and has performed all Services outside of the United States.\n12.

Add a new event in your Bookings section. Set your event information, and availability, then start taking appointments. Review and manage your bookings easily.\nThe Bookings section is available for all pricing plans - Free, Limited, Pro and VIP. However, each plan type has different limits on the number of bookable events allowed:\nFree plan - Limited to 1 event\nLimited plan - Up to 4 events\nPro plan - Up to 10 events\nVIP plan - Up to 100 events\nWhat type of businesses can use the Bookings Section?\nWe currently support 1-on-1 and 1-on-Multiple attendees booking modes. Some examples of the types of businesses that use Bookings include:\nBeauty and Hair Salons\nHealth Consultations\nYoga / Fitness / Dance\nPet Care\nFashion Stylists\nBusiness Consultations\nAdventure Bookings\nCleaning Services\nDentistry\nChiropractic Services\nMassage Services\nNote: More complicated services like hotel rentals are not fully supported right now. If you are in a service or industry that you don't see here, send us a message via support, and we'll keep you updated in the future!\nHow do I add the booking section to my site?\nGo to your site editor and click \"Add New Section\" in the left panel.\nGo to \"Commerce\" and select the \"Booking\" section from the list.\nHere's what it looks like.\nHow do I set up your event type?\nThere are two ways to go to the Booking settings:\nClick on the booking section you've added.\nGo to your Settings > Bookings > Event Type.\nOnce you are there, click on the \"Add Event Type\" button to get started.\u00a0Adding an event type is similar to adding products in the store section. You can set the image, name, and description, and copy the item URL as an individual page. Event types have some unique fields:\nLocation\nRequired field. Your attendees will see this in the email and event info. This can be a physical location like an address, or just \"online.\"\nDuration\nYou can select 15 minutes / 30 minutes / 45 minutes / 1 hour / 1.5 hours / 2 hours / 3 hours / 4 hours to determine how long each booking will be. This is the duration of an individual booking, for example, a single customer's salon appointment.\nFor example in the attendee view - the change of duration will impact on the live site:\nIf you set 30 minutes, the time slots start from your weekly hours and show 10:00am-10:30am, 10:30am-11:00am, 11:00am-11:30am\u2026\nIf you set 1 hour, show 10:00am-11:00am, 11:00am-12:00an, 12:00am-1:00pm\u2026\nIf you set 4 hours, show 10:00am-2:00pm, 2:00pm-6:00pm, 6:00pm-10:00pm\u2026\nAvailability\nThis setting determines when bookings are available. You can set Recurring Weekly Hours and Fixed Date Overrides. This is designed for recurring routines and special day schedules (e.g. holidays).\nFixed Date Overrides will override the time of Recurring Weekly Hours if they overlap. For example, if you've set a recurring availability for MON 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM, and you've set an override on Jan 24, 2022 (Monday) as \"Not Available\", your attendee will not be able to book for Jan 24, 2022.\nYou also have the option to adjust the time zone within the availability settings. Simply click on the default time zone and select your preferred one.\nAttendee experience in the live site\nAfter you've set up an event type (with duration and availability), your site visitors will be able to make bookings. Visitors will select the event type and see a date & time picker, with the slots that are available to book:\nUpon successful booking, the visitor will receive a booking confirmation email.\nIf your customers want to cancel their bookings, they'll have to contact you directly and you can manually cancel a booking in the editor (Editor > Bookings > Scheduled). Please note that we can only cancel the whole event for now. The cancelation for the single-booking attendee is not yet supported yet, but this function is coming soon!\nManage your events\nFind this inside the Editor > Bookings > Scheduled > Upcoming / Past.\nWhen a new booking has been made, this list will show a booking record with Event Date, Start & End Time, Event Name, and Attendees\nEvent Date: This shows the time the attendee selected when making the booking.\nStart & End Time: This shows the time the attendee selected when making the booking.\nEvent Name: This shows the event name when this booking was made. (It won\u2019t be changed even if you change the event name in the future.)\nAttendees: Shows information about the attendee's name and contact info\nFor more details, you can download your event CSV file that displays all booking records from your attendees.\nNote:\nCurrently, the Booking section does not support adding a payment gateway directly. However, you can still provide payment options to your customers by adding payment details in the booking description or by using the Simple Store feature and creating a service product. If you would like to add a Simple Store section, here are the steps to follow.\nPlease shoot any questions and feedback over to\u00a0support@strikingly.com\u00a0or\u00a0chat\u00a0with us.\nWas this article helpful?\n13 out of 18 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

If you are not displaying ads from an ad network, you don\u2019t need to worry about this setting at all.\nWhat are Ads.txt and App-ads.txt?\nAds.txt (Authorized Digital Sellers file) is a file listing all the companies that are authorized to sell ads on your site. It can help buyers identify counterfeit inventory and help you receive more advertiser spend that might have otherwise gone toward that counterfeit inventory. To create an ads.txt file, you can manually compile a list of sellers and publisher IDs separated by commas, or retrieve ads.txt files from third parties such as Google AdSense. Learn more about Ads.txt\nApp-ads.txt (Authorized Digital Sellers file for Apps) is similar to Ads.txt, but used for native apps. Before adding App-ads.txt, you will need to connect your apps to the current domain by including the website URL in app store listings. Learn more about App-ads.txt\nHow do I add Ads.txt and App-ads.txt?\nTo add Ads.txt and App-ads.txt to your site, go to \u2018Settings\u2019 > \u2018Services\u2019 > \u2018Ads.txt & App-ads.txt\u2019\nClick \u201cSet Ads.txt & App-Ads.txt\u201d.

Click the \u201cApp-ads.txt\u201d tab to paste your App-ads.txt.\nClick the \u201cSave\u201d button.\nHow can I verify whether Ads.txt or App-ads.txt is added to my site successfully?\nYou can view the Ads.txt and App-ads.txt by visiting your site\u2019s root domain and adding \u2018/ads.txt\u2019 or \u2018/app-ads.txt\u2019 to the end of the URL.

The purpose of this is to increase your successful delivery rate and sender reputation, which helps to ensure your emails are not marked as spam by recipients in the future.\nIn your Audience List, you may see contacts who are marked as \"unreachable\". This means their email is incorrect, dummy, fake, or temporary. You will not be able to send emails or newsletters to unreachable email addresses.\nWhat can I do?\nIf the email address is wrong (e.g. due to a typo upon submission) and you know the correct address, you can manually import the correct email as a new contact and delete the unreachable email contact. If you don't need to contact this person, then you don't have to worry about anything.In case you need assistance, shoot us a line at support@strikingly.com or chat with us.\nWas this article helpful?\n3 out of 5 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

Your site audience members who meet the trigger will receive a custom automated email. For example, by setting up email automation, visitors who submit a custom event registration form on your site can receive an automated email with details of the event. Find this feature in the Site Editor > Audience > Email Automation.Note: This feature is only available for PRO users and above.\n1. Select the trigger and send time\nTriggers options:\nWhen a visitor submits the form.\nSubmit any form.\nVisitors who submit any form on your site will receive an automatic email.\nSubmit the specified form.\nVisitors will receive an automatic email only if they submit a specific form.\nWhen a visitor completes a purchase.\nPurchase any product.\nVisitors who purchase any product will receive an automated email.\nPurchase a specific product.\nVisitors will receive an automatic email only if they purchase a specific product.\nWhen a visitor becomes a member.\nBecome a member at any membership tier.\nVisitors who become a member will receive an automated email.\nBecome a member at a specific membership tier.\nVisitors will receive an automatic email only if they become a member at a specific membership tier.\nWhen a visitor subscribes to the blog.\nVisitors who subscribe to the blog will receive an automated email.\nWhen a visitor abandons a shopping cart.\nVisitors who have added items to their cart but have not yet purchased will receive this email.\nTiming options:\nSend immediately after triggering\nSend ( ) days later after the trigger. (Enter a number from 1 to 100)\nThe email will be sent at the same time of day as when the trigger was hit. For example: If set as 5 days later, and a visitor submits a form at noon on Jan 1, they will receive the automated email at noon on Jan 6.\n[Abandoned cart timing option] Send the email when the visitor has not purchased after adding to the cart for ( ) hours.\nFor example: If the timing is set to 3 hours and a visitor adds items into their cart at 1 pm but doesn\u2019t complete the purchase, they will receive the abandoned cart email at 4 pm.\n2. Edit automatic email content\nBy default, you will see the preset template for your trigger. Different triggers will correspond to different templates.\nThe preset template for form response will show the submitted form info in the email body. You can also replace the default content with anything you want to communicate to your audience.\nThe preset template for abandoned cart will show a list of products that the visitor abandoned in his cart, and the default button action is to open the checkout page for the visitor so that they can continue checking out. For best performance, we recommend that you do not remove the product list and button link from the abandoned cart recovery emails.\nBefore you can activate automatic email, you will need to fill in the email subject and sender profile.\n3. Manage the automation\nYou will see all automation in the list.\nWhen you are satisfied with the trigger and content of your email, you can click \"Activate\" to enable it.

How can I solve it?\nTo activate your automated emails, you can follow these steps:\nSet up DKIM authentication for your domain email. DKIM helps verify the authenticity of your emails and improves their deliverability.\nUse a spam checker tool to identify any potential spam indicators, like\u00a0Mailmeteor's free spam checker. This helps you see and make sure that your automated email content has no spammy words in it.\nIs it possible to add {{NAME}} on the subject line for automated emails?\nUnfortunately, it's not currently possible to add {{NAME}} or any other dynamic variables to the subject line of automated emails. However, you can include the recipient's name within the email content by using the \"Insert Recipient Name\" feature.\nIn case you need assistance, shoot us a line at\u00a0support@strikingly.com\u00a0or\u00a0chat with us.\nWas this article helpful?\n3 out of 4 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

This is a great way to convert your existing customers into repeat buyers.\nUsing Strikingly's powerful\u00a0Membership feature\u00a0and Simple Store coupons, you can launch your own campaign to drive your customers back to your online store!\nLet's get started:\nSet up your online store\nAdding a store to your site is easy! If you haven't set up your store yet,\u00a0follow the steps in this article.\nCreate your discount coupons\nOnce you're done setting up your store, start creating coupons!\u00a0 These coupons will be distributed to your members via your secure members-only page (we'll deal with that later). You can offer seasonal discounts, or permanent discount codes for your members to encourage them to buy again from your store.\nAnd here are a few useful tips:\nKeep the coupon codes short and easy to remember.\nMake it relevant. If it's New Year, offer a coupon code like START2020 or NEWYEAR20. For your Valentine's campaign, use LOVEMYSELF or 14HUGS.\nTo create a sense of urgency for your customers, create a limited-time coupon by setting an expiration date.\nOnce your store and coupon setup is done, you can now proceed to activate your site's membership!\nActivate your site's membership feature\nThis step is important to secure your coupon codes and make sure that only repeat customers can have access. In this setting, anyone who purchases from your store automatically becomes a member.\n1. Exit your store manager. From the left panel, click Settings > Membership, or click Audience > Membership.\n2. Under Registration Method, choose \"Grant Membership to Store Customers\" and click \"Next\". This means that all customers who buy a product will automatically receive a login account and password.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0Personalize the email notification that your customers receive when they become members. Everyone loves a personalized message! Go to Settings > Membership > Email Notifications. Click \"Edit\" under \"Notifications sent to member\".\nWe'd recommend that you keep it short and sweet to not distract your customers from the value that you are offering--discounts on the next purchase.\nCreate your member's page\nYour member's page will house all coupon codes that you will distribute to your loyal members. This page is secured with individual usernames and passwords. You need to activate multi-pages to set up a members-only page, so let's start with that step!\n1. From your site editor, click Settings > Multiple Pages. Activate the multiple pages feature by clicking the green \"Activate Multiple Pages\" button.\n2. Once activated, exit the settings panel and click \"Manage\" from the left panel.\n3. \u00a0Click the green \"Add New Page\" button. Type the name of your new page. In this example, we used \"Coupons\" (so it's easy).\n4. Click the gear icon beside your new member's page, and set it as \"members only\".\n5. On the next window, you can choose \"Only registered members who purchased a specific product\" and select the product. You can also select other options depending on who the coupon is for.\n6. When you're done, click \"Back to Site Design\" and start adding sections and design your own coupon page. Be creative!\nTest out your new website!\nWhen you're done setting up content for your members-only page, go back to Settings > Membership. Copy and paste the test logins and save them in your notepad. Hit \"Publish\" and you're live! You can now use the test logins to check your buyer flow.\nTry it out!\u00a0Here's a sample site:\u00a0http://ilovepastry.mystrikingly.com/\u00a0\u00a0(Don't worry, you won't get charged if you make purchases!)\n___________________\nDid you know?\nYou can also make online courses using Strikingly's membership feature.

A human touch goes a long way to building trust in your business.\nYou can now add a Live Chat widget directly to your site. Here's what it looks like:\nWatch our quick video tutorial here:\nAdding Live Chat\nNote: Live chat functionality is available for users with a Limited or Pro plan, provided they also have an Audience plan (An Audience Plan is an add-on plan that you can add on top of any Pro or Limited plan. It lets you adjust the audience size that's appropriate for your business. To learn more about the Audience Plan and how it powers the Membership feature, click here). On the VIP plan, the Live Chat function comes with the plan.\nOnce your account can activate Live Chat, you can enable it in your site editor through Settings > Live Chat > Activate Live Chat:\nTip:\u00a0Use your first name and a beautiful headshot of your face to make your visitors much more likely to chat with you. Visitors want to see that a real person is behind your site!\nEnabling Phone Notifications\nWe recommend enabling notifications in your Strikingly phone app so you can always get notified if a visitor reaches out to you in Live Chat. Just download our iPhone app or Android app and log in to start receiving notifications! Just tap on the notification to reply directly to your visitor audience from your phone.\nNote: The Strikingly app must be running in the background on your phone/tablet to receive notifications. Some Android phone manufacturers automatically kill certain apps in the background. To ensure notifications are received promptly, make sure the Strikingly App is set to be allowed to run in the background. To prevent your Android phone from doing this, please check this guide.\nEnabling Desktop Notifications\nWe recommend enabling notifications in your browser to get notified if a visitor reaches out to you in Live Chat. If you're using Chrome or Firefox, you will receive notifications as long as your browser is open (or running in the background), even if you don't have Strikingly open in a tab. If you accidentally disabled notifications and would like to re-enable them, read this guide for Chrome or this guide for Firefox.\nMake sure you allow notifications on strikingly.com!\nResponding to Visitors\nYou can see incoming Live Chat messages by going to the Audience tab > Live Chat. Click on a contact to respond to those visitors.\nThe desktop notification is a shortcut to enter the chat screen, even if you don't have the Strikingly dashboard open in a browser tab. See the above sections on how to set up desktop notifications.\nYou can also respond to visitors through the Strikingly App on iOS or Android. You can receive a mobile notification whenever someone messages you on your site, and you can immediately tap on the notification to start chatting with the visitor through our phone app. Here's what the Strikingly app looks like when you're replying:\nSetting Up Email Forms\nYou can choose whether to prompt your site visitors to enter their email before they start chatting with you. Requiring users to enter their email addresses before chatting might reduce conversion to live chat a bit, but it ensures that you can always reach back out to those visitors via email, even if they leave your site.\nThe best part about Live Chat is that all visitors who enter the system are automatically added to your contact list.\u00a0Even if you're offline, you can collect email addresses and messages and respond to the visitor at your convenience. Or, you can export these email addresses and use your own mailing list.\nInviting Live Chat Collaborators\nYou can also invite other members of your team as collaborators to help you respond to live chats! If you're on a VIP or Audience plan, visit the Collaborators Manager in Settings > Team > Add Teammate. Here, you can invite your colleagues as collaborators using their email addresses. Assign them an \"Agent\" role to only give them access to your site's Audience page and Live chat.\nAfter accepting the invitation, this collaborator will be able to log into Strikingly using their own email address. When they log into Strikingly, they will see your site in their dashboard's site list. There, they can click the \"Live Chat\" button to see & respond to all live chats for this site. Live Chat collaborators will also receive notifications for new live chat messages.\nDisable/Turn off/Remove Live Chat\nTo disable the chat feature from your website, click the \"Disattiva LiveChat\" link as shown below:\nThen, click \"OK\" from the pop-up box to confirm.Have some questions?

We have the \"Portfolio\" section that allows you to do that for your customers to let them see what you offer. There are a few things, though, that you'd have to keep in mind when showing your product line-up online:\nShow a detailed view of or images of your products. People buying on the internet can't really see what your products actually look like, so it's best to have photos with exceptional quality.\nGive it a premium \"feel\". You'd want people to get more interested in what you're selling. Since your customers can't check your products physically, it is good to have images that highlight the product itself. A clear image of your product against a white background usually does the trick!\nSetting up a product showcase should be easy. Let me show you how you can do it:\nIn your site editor, click the \"Add new section\" button on the left panel.\nScroll down and pick the \"Creative Portfolio\" or \"Product Catalog\" section.\nClick \"Add Product\" in the section.\nStart adding your products like how you would in a regular \"Simple Store\" section. Click the \"Add New Item\" button.\nYou can add up to 10 images on each product, and a product description of up to 1200 characters.The images will be shown as below. Notice that there are thumbnails, which you can click if you'd like to view and enlarge the other images on the product page.\u00a0There are also options for you to utilize, such as\nShow Price\u00a0- Display your product pricing to make it easier for your customers in making a buying decision.\nShow Button\u00a0- Link your product to a product review page. Since online buyers can't go to a physical store to inspect the product quality, most of them rely on other buyers' feedback.\nCategories\u00a0- On a Pro/VIP account, you can use \"Categories\" to organize your product showcase if you are selling different products. For instance, you sell a lot of apparel. You can create categories like Shirts, Jeans, Shorts, Dresses, etc. Here's how you can set up categories.\nShow Detailed Description\u00a0 - Aside from the product description page, you can add more details here about your product, such as ingredients, directions for use, etc. The Detailed Description also allows up to ten more images.\nUse custom product URL\u00a0- On Pro/VIP, you can use a link that's specific to each product you're showcasing, which makes it easier for your potential buyers to remember.\nWhen you're done adding all info on your product page, hit \"Save\". This will automatically update the Product Showcase on your live site if previously published.\nAdding Categories to Product Showcase\nTo add and manage product categories, go to your Creative Portfolio section, then click \"Categories\". Click the \"Add new category\" button to create. You can also rename, delete, or reorder categories in this panel.Adding Products to CategoriesAfter setting up your categories, go back to your product manager to add products to the categories.\nPick one product to edit and click the \"Select a category\" drop-down menu to add a category tag. You can add up to five category tags for each product. Click \"Save\" when you're done.Once you've added and saved the category tags for each one of your products, the Creative Portfolio section should show all categories on a menu at the top. This is one way to show product categorization.Another way to showcase your products with one product category per section is by selecting a specific category tag. If you choose to do it this way, only those products tagged with the specific category will be shown in the Creative Portfolio section.\nAdding Region Options:\nVIP users can now show different prices for visitors from different regions. To add region options, go to Settings > Portfolio > Portfolio Settings and click the \"Add New Region Options\" button.\nYou will be asked to choose the country/region, the currency, the item, and its region price. Don't forget to click Save and Done when you finish adding the details.\nHow many products can I add?\nFree plan: 6 productsLimited plan: 10 productsPro: 500 productsVIP: Unlimited\nIf you have questions or feedback for us about our Product Showcase feature, reach out to us at support@strikingly.com\u00a0or\u00a0chat\u00a0with us!\nWas this article helpful?\n3 out of 3 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

In this case, the tax rate will not be added to the total price that the customer must pay. Instead, it is simply indicated as \"included\" in the price.\nYou can set this using the\u00a0Tax Calculation\u00a0setting. By default, this is set to \"Taxes are added,\" which means any tax rate you set will be added to the order price before payment.\nInstead, you can set it to \"Taxes are included,\" which means any tax rate you set will\u00a0not be added to the order price. Instead, the tax rate will merely be indicated as \"tax included.\"\nCan I set different tax rates for different regions?\nYes, if you select \"US State\" tax mode or \"European VAT\" tax mode, you can set a different tax rate for certain regions.\nHow is the tax calculated based on these settings?\nFor example, assume a product has a price of\u00a0\u20ac10.00, with no shipping fee. Assume the tax rate for Germany is 19%, and the tax rate for Switzerland is 7.7%. Now let's see what happens when a customer goes through checkout for this one item:\nIf tax calculation is set to\u00a0Tax Added:\nA customer shipping to Germany will pay a total of \u20ac11.90. The 19% tax (\u20ac1.90) is added to the order price.\nA customer shipping to Switzerland will pay a total of \u20ac10.77. The 7.7% tax (\u20ac0.77) is added to the order price.\nIf tax calculation is set to\u00a0Tax Included:\nA customer shipping to Germany will pay a total of \u20ac10.00. This price will be automatically calculated as \u20ac8.40 for the product and \u20ac1.60 for the tax (since \u20ac1.60 is 19% of \u20ac8.40.)\nA customer shipping to Switzerland will pay a total of \u20ac10.00. This price will be automatically calculated as \u20ac9.29 for the product and \u20ac0.71 for the tax (since \u20ac0.71 is 7.7% of \u20ac9.29.)\nIn both cases, the customer will see this clearly indicated at checkout.\nWhen I export my orders, will I see how much tax is included?\nYes, when you export your orders as CSV (useful for external processing), there is a column to indicate if the tax value is \"Tax Included\" or not. There is a \"Tax\" column, which shows the tax value, and a \"Tax Included\" column, which is either TRUE or FALSE. If TRUE, that means the tax value was included in the price.\nFor more information about tax settings, please see the main article on tax settings.\nFor questions drop us a line at\u00a0support@strikingly.com\u00a0or\u00a0chat\u00a0with us.\nWas this article helpful?\n0 out of 1 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

Can I create coupons for a Paid Subscription Membership?\n2. Can I set specific products in my Simple Store to have recurring payments?\n3. How does monthly payment recur if the initial payment starts on the 31st of a month?\n4. Can I edit the amount of each existing pricing?\nDifference between PRO and VIP\nPRO\nVIP\nSupports 1 Membership Tier\nSupports Up To 5 Membership Tiers\nHow to Sell Subscription Memberships\nBefore setting up Paid Membership, we recommend you read through Activate the Membership\u00a0first.\n1. Connect your Stripe account\nWe currently\u00a0only support Stripe as the payment gateway for Paid Subscriptions. Connect your Stripe account in Settings > Accept Payment first. Make sure your Stripe is \"Enabled\". See how to connect to Stripe here.\n2. Select Registration Method & Set a price\nThen, in your Membership settings, set the Registration Method to Paid Subscription Membership and set a monthly price.\nNote:\nThe price will automatically be billed to your members on a recurring basis until they cancel or you cancel the subscription, or until the payment fails.\nThe price is billed every month, quarter, or year.\nRecurring payments are collected on the same day of the month. For example, if a monthly subscription is started on January 1, it will renew on February 1, March 1, etc.\nThe price must be greater than or equal to US$0.50 in any currency.\nIf the amount is less than US$0.50 equivalent, the payment will fail! Regardless of your selected currency, please make sure the price's USD equivalent is at least US$0.50.\nIf you have Paid Subscription Memberships, you must keep your Stripe connection active. If you disconnect Stripe, all of your recurring subscriptions will be terminated immediately.\n3. Add Multiple Membership Tiers (Available for VIP users)\nYou can create a new tier by clicking the \"+ADD TIER\" button. You can create up to 5 tiers on one site.\nMultiple membership tiers can be reordered by dragging & drop the burger icon on the left. This will change the order they will appear for your customer when they register.\n4. Delete membership tier\nDelete a tier by clicking the 'Delete' button on the bottom right of the edit tier popup if you don't want to sell this tier anymore.\nWhen you delete a membership tier with the \"Free Membership\" or \"Buy Product to Register\" registration method, it will be deleted immediately, and visitors will not be able to select this tier anymore upon registration.\nWhen you delete a membership tier with the \"Paid Subscription Membership\" tier:\nNew visitors will not be able to select this tier anymore upon registration.\nFor any existing members who are still actively paying for the subscription: Their membership will expire after their current billing period, and will no longer be renewed. This tier will become a \"legacy tier\" which holds any remaining expiring memberships. Once all memberships have expired, the legacy tier will also be deleted.\nYou can click \"View legacy tiers\" to view these expiring tiers.\nInformation about former members will still be kept in the Audience list, labeled as \"Former Member.\"\n5. Manage Subscriptions in Strikingly Orders.\nYou can view all subscriptions in Orders - Subscriptions. Each subscription has a status:\nActive: The customer has paid successfully, and the subscription is ongoing.\nCanceled: The subscription was canceled by the site owner or members, this subscription will show Cancelled status. The customer is no longer billed, and they will no longer be able to access \"paid members only\" content.\nPayment Failed: A renewal payment has failed. The customer is no longer billed, and they will no longer be able to access \"paid members only\" content.\nAs the site owner, you can manually cancel a subscription on the Subscription Detail page. Upon cancellation, this member will no longer have access to \"paid members only\" content, and will no longer be billed.\nIn the Subscription History section, you can see the history of events relating to this subscription, including each payment time.\nSetting Up Members-Only Pages\nGive your customers access to exclusive online content by creating members-only pages. For more details, please see\u00a0Add Membership to Your Website!\n1. On your site editor, click Manage.\n2. Click the gear icon of the page that you want to set as members-only.\nMembers only:\u00a0all free members, paid members, and members with cancelled subscriptions will see this page.\nPaid members only: the paid members with an active paid subscription will see this page.\nSpecific tiers: only members of the selected tiers will see this page.\nMembers who purchased a specific product: (if you already have a Simple\u00a0Store on your site), Store customers who purchased a specific product will see this page.\nYou can set up existing pages as members-only, or you can start with a new page. All sections will be available for you to add!\nView Member Information in Audience List\nIn the Audience list, you can view all your members by clicking the \"Members\" tab or by applying a custom filter to view only selected membership tiers.\nWhen viewing the details for an Audience contact, in the left sidebar there are ways to edit a user's membership.\nYou can delete membership for any member. When you do this, they will no longer be able to log in. If the membership is a paid membership, they will no longer be billed.\nYou can also grant membership to an existing non-member user. When you do this, the user will receive an email with the login URL. You will be able to select which tier you want to grant. If you choose to grant a paid membership tier, this user will not be billed. You can use this to bypass the billing system but still grant specific memberships to specific users. (If you want to grant membership to a new user, you will need to Import contacts manually\u00a0first.)\nTest Account\nWhen you activate a membership on your site, we automatically create a test account so you can see what your site looks like to a member. You can see the details from your Membership page settings > Log in URL.To test different membership tiers, you can select a tier for your test account. Then, when you log into your live site using this test account, you'll see your site as if you're a member of that tier.\nWhat Your Customer Sees\nView this example site:\u00a0http://paidmembership.mystrikingly.com/\n1. Register & checkout\nWhen a visitor opens the registration URL, they will see a popup. If your site has multiple membership tiers, the visitor will be prompted to select a membership tier. The tiers will be listed in the same order that they were configured in your store's Membership settings.\nIf the tier has many payment options (e.g. monthly, yearly), those will be shown as various payment options.\nNote: \"Buy Product to Register\" tiers will not be shown here, since the visitor must buy an item from the store to gain membership.\nNote: Even if your customers cancel the checkout or the initial payment failed, they will have a free membership. In this case, they can begin a subscription via the \"My Account\" menu on your live site.\n2. View Subscription in My Account\nYour members are able to view their subscription details in the \"My Account\" menu after logging into your site. They can also cancel anytime.\nWhen the subscription is canceled, the customer's membership will revert to a free membership, and will no longer have access to the \"paid member only\" content.\nA free member will see other paid membership tiers and can subscribe to one from the tiers list.\nWhen the renewal payment failed, the subscription will become canceled and will expire immediately.\nDifference between Registration Methods\nRegistration Method\nCustomer Experience\nFree Membership\nAnyone can register, no payment is required.\nPaid Subscription Membership\nA member is required to subscribe & pay for the Paid Membership during the registration.\nBuy Product to Register\nBuy Any Product to Register\nAny customer who buys a product from your store will receive a membership via email.\nBuy Specific Product to Register\nAny customer who buys specific products from your store will receive a membership via email.\nFor more details, we recommend you read these related tutorials:\nAdd Membership to Your Website!\nSell Your Online Courses with Membership\nFAQ\n1. Can I create coupons for a Paid Subscription Membership?\nCurrently, our coupons do not support Paid Subscription Membership. If you need this feature, please let us know via online support.\n2. Can I set specific products in my Simple Store to have recurring payments?\nUnfortunately, no. Currently, our Paid Membership function is tied to our Membership function, and not to our Simple Store, since the recurring payment subscription model works differently than regular store products.\n3. How does monthly payment recur if the initial payment starts on the 31st of a month?\nExample: A $10/month subscription begins on July 31. The customer will be billed as follows:\nJuly 31 = $10.00\nAugust 31 = $10.00\nOctober 1= $10.00\nOctober 31= $10.00\n4. Can I edit the amount of each existing pricing?\nNo, you cannot directly edit the amount of each existing pricing. However, you can uncheck an existing pricing. If you uncheck it, existing members who belong to this pricing will continue to pay, but non-members won't see this pricing and won't be able to purchase it.\nIf you decide to check the existing pricing again after unchecking it, there won't be any effect on existing members. But the pricing option will become visible to non-members, and they'll be able to purchase it.\nPlease note, you need to keep at least one pricing option checked at all times.\n5. Are there any transaction fees for paid membership subscription?\nYes, we use Stripe for recurring payment. The transaction fees for Stripe differ based on your location. Please\u00a0refer to Stripe's website\u00a0or\u00a0contact their support\u00a0for detailed fee information. Strikingly.com also charges additional fees for using payment gateways. You can find information about transaction fees on your pricing page.\n6. Can I use Square for paid membership subscription?\nNo, we currently only support Stripe for recurring payment processing.\nWas this article helpful?\n6 out of 7 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

Just upload a file and set a price. Customers will receive a download link upon purchase, and they have 72 hours to download the file before it expires.\nThis tutorial will show you how to sell Digital Download products.\nContents\nHow to Sell Digital Products\n1. Connect your Custom Domain\n2.\u00a0Select the Product Type\n3. Create Your Digital Product & Upload a File\n4.\u00a0Manage Orders and Generate New Download Link\nWhat Your Customer Sees\nFAQ\nHow to Sell Digital Products\nBefore setting up Digital Products, make sure you've already set up your\u00a0Custom Domain.\n1. Connect your Custom Domain & Payments\nWe currently only support Stripe, PayPal & Square as the payment gateway for Digital Products. Make sure either Stripe, PayPal, or Square is enabled in Settings - Accept Payments first.\u00a0See how to connect to Stripe\u00a0& See how to set up a Simple Store.\nThe download link of your digital products will use the Custom Domain you set in Settings - Domain. You must connect/register a valid Custom Domain before selling Digital Products in Strikingly.\n* Please ensure your domain has already been successfully connected. If you connect an invalid domain, your buyers cannot request any valid download link from your website after the purchase!\n2.\u00a0Select the Product Type\nWhen you add a new product, you can select from Digital Download products (music files, e-books, docs), Physical products (clothes, jewelry, electronics), or Service products (consulting, training, coaching) on your website.\nEach Product Type has some differences:\nPhysical\nService\nDigital Download\nProduct Information\nName, Description, Images, Prices, Categories, Page Description, Variants & Options, Stock, Shipping\nName, Description, Images, Prices, Categories, Page Description, Variants & Options, Stock\nName, Description, Images, Prices, Categories, Page Description, File Uploader\nCheckout Information\nFirst/Last Name, Shipping Address (ZIP, City, Province, Country), Email, Phone, Notes\n*collect this customer info during checkout\nFirst/Last Name, Email, Phone, Notes\n*collect this customer info during checkout\nFirst/Last Name, Email, Phone, Notes\n*collect this customer info during checkout\nAccept Payments (also depends on your region)\nStripe\nPayPal\nSquare\nOffline Payments\nStripe\nPayPal\nSquare\nOffline Payments\nStripe\nPayPal\nSquare\nAllows Order Refund\nYes\nYes\nYes\n3. Upload a File for Digital Product\nAfter selecting the \"Digital Download\" product type, click \"Upload File\" in the product editor to select a file.\nCurrently accepted file formats:\nImage: .jpg, .png, .gif (image files will not be compressed)\nAudio: .mp3, .mp4, .wav, .flac, .m4a\nDocument: .pdf, .doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx, .ppt, .pptx, .odt, .odp, .epub, txt, key, numbers, wps\nZip Files: .zip, .zipx, .7z, .rar\nThe maximum file size is 500MB, and you may only select one file.\n4.\u00a0Manage Orders and Generate New Download Link\nUnlike Physical & Service Product orders, the orders of Digital Product will be \"Completed\" automatically after your customer has paid. You don't need to manually complete the order, and there is no way to cancel the order after the buyer has completed the purchase. However, you can still refund it.\nWhat Your Customer Sees\nAfter it's purchased, the file is available for download on the Order Confirmation page. Also, the customer will automatically receive an order confirmation email with a download link to the file.\nNote: This download link is unique to that purchase, and is only valid for 72 hours after purchase. This prevents link-sharing by the customer.\nIf you need to send a new download link to a customer after the 72-hour expiration, you can go to the order details page in your orders list, and click Generate new download link\u00a0beside the item name. This copies a new generate link to your clipboard, which you can then manually send to the customer. This new download link is also valid for 72 hours.\nTips: You can use our Audience Plan (LiveChat & Send via Email) to send your customer this new link!

Coupons work just like normal.\n2. Can I set up Tax Rate for Digital Products only?\nWe don't support Tax Rate for Digital Products yet. Our current tax mode varies by shipping location for Physical or Service Products.\n3.\u00a0Can I add quantity and variants to Digital Products?\nUnfortunately, it is not possible to select the quantity or add variants for Digital Products. Please add a new digital product to upload a different file.\n4. Can I checkout Digital Products and Physical/Service Products in one order?\nDue to the difference between Digital Download and other product types, we currently restrict customers to purchase the Digital Download products individually and separately. For example, you can't proceed to checkout with Digital Product A,\u00a0Digital Product B, Physical Product C. The customer must checkout Digital Product A by itself.\n5.\u00a0Can I replace the file for my Digital Products?\nYes, you can. If the customer's link is still valid,\u00a0the link will download the latest file. If not, if you need to send the customer the new version of the file, you will need to manually generate a download link for them.\n6. If I remove the existing Digital Product, can my customers still download it?\nIf you delete the product from your product list, customers who purchased this file will lose access to this product immediately. If you want to stop selling the product yet keep any existing download links valid, you may \"Hide\" the product in your product list.\n7. Can I sell Digital Products on the Free plan?\nYou must be on a Pro plan or above to sell digital products.\nRelated Articles:\nGetting Started with Simple Store\nManaging Products on Simple Store\nAdding Product Categories\nWas this article helpful?\n3 out of 3 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

An Audience Plan allows you to:\nAdd Live Chat\u00a0to your site (learn more)\nAccept more Membership Registrations\u00a0on your site, including Paid Subscription Memberships (learn more)\nSend more\u00a0Newsletters & emails\u00a0to your audience members (learn more)\nWhat is an Active Contact?\nPricing for the Audience Plan works via a sliding scale, depending on how many active contacts\u00a0you'd like in your account. Active contacts\u00a0are the sum of:\nthe number of Live Chats across your sites in the current calendar month\nthe number of unique contacts that you send emails to (via newsletters and 1-on-1 messaging) in a given calendar month\nthe number of membership registrations across all your sites\nNotes:\nActive contacts do not include\u00a0contact form submissions, email form submissions, and Simple Store customers. You can always have an unlimited number of those!\nActive contacts do not count the messages you send. You can send as many messages as you want, but please be aware that spamming your audience too often will result in poor email deliverability and may hurt your site's reputation.\nWithout an Audience Plan, Free, Limited, & Pro users can have up to 100 active contacts, and VIP users can have up to 2000 active contacts.\nYou can see your current active contacts at the bottom of the Audience tab of your dashboard.\nThe contacts are counted per account and not per site.\nHow Do I Upgrade?\nThis is your first time upgrading to an audience plan? Strikingly gives you a 7-day trial period. Click here to check our plans!\nNote: The Audience Plan is only available if you're already on a paid plan on Strikingly (Limited, Pro, or VIP). Pricing starts at $10/month and scales up as you need more active contacts.\nIn case you need assistance, shoot us a line at\u00a0support@strikingly.com\u00a0or\u00a0chat\u00a0with us.\nWas this article helpful?\n4 out of 4 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

Use this to incentivize your customers to boost their order amount.\nNote: This feature is only available for Pro users and up.\nHow to Add Free Shipping Policy\nBefore setting up the Free Shipping policy, make sure you've set up Shipping for Simple Store.\nGo to your site editor > Store > Shipping.\nSelect a Shipping Option to edit.\nClick the checkbox \"Grant free shipping to orders of at least a certain amount (before tax)\" and fill in the threshold price:\nIf you set this threshold price as $100, your customer will have a free shipping fee when they added products of $100 (subtotal) to the cart.\nWhat Your Customer Sees\nIn the following places, your customers will see the free shipping policy info. Once you have an order over the certain price you set, the shipping fee will be redeemed to 0 in this order.\nProduct Detail Page:\nCart Page:\nOrder Confirmation Page:\nFAQ\nWhat is the Free shipping threshold price based on? Does it count before the discount?\nThe amount used to check if an order qualifies for free shipping is the subtotal price of items in the customer's cart, before tax and discount. For example, if your store has a $100 free shipping threshold, and a customer has an order with a $120 subtotal, $40 discount, and $10 tax, the customer will be granted a $0 shipping fee. Their total price will be $120 - $40 + $0 + $10 = $90.\nIn case you need assistance, shoot us a line at\u00a0support@strikingly.com\u00a0or\u00a0chat\u00a0with us.\nWas this article helpful?\n1 out of 1 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

Use pop-ups to boost your site's lead generation and engagement.\nHow to add a pop-up?\nIt's super easy to activate a pop-up for your site -- just go to\u00a0Settings > Promotion > Pop-Ups. This feature is only available for Pro users & up.\nThere are three types of pop-ups available:\nEmail Form\nShow a simple email form to let your audience sign up for newsletters, updates, or anything else.\nAnnouncement\nShow a simple image + text. Great for announcing coupon codes or exciting news.\nAge Verification\nEnter custom text and allow the visitor to enter or exit. If they choose to enter, the visitor will go to a simple \"content restricted\" page.\nWhat can I customize in these pop-ups?\nAll pop-ups allow you to choose from three different layouts: centered, image on left, and image on right.\nAll pop-ups support a custom text and image.\nThe Email Form popup allows you to create a simple email form and rename the form elements as you wish.\nClick \"More options\" to also set a thank-you message on the form submission and a notification email so you'll be notified of any new submissions.\nYou can see these pop-up form responses in the Audience list of your site! Just filter your Audience by choosing the\"Pop-Up Form.\"\nThe Announcement pop-up allows you to set custom buttons that lead to different parts of your site or to an external site.\nThe Age Verification pop-up allows you to show verifications before entering the site.\nHow are these pop-ups triggered?\nYou can change when and where the popup will show. You'll see it under Time Delay (how long before it shows) and Show On Pages (which pages will it show).\nAfter configuring your pop-up, save the settings and publish your site. Your live site will now show the pop-up when a visitor views it!\nIf a visitor refreshes the site, the pop-up won't show again for the rest of their visit session -- this prevents annoying repeat visitors with the same pop-ups.\nHow to remove/disable/turn off the pop-ups?\nIf you want to remove the pop-ups from your website, go to the pop-up page and click the \"Disable Pop-up\" link.\nWas this article helpful?\n17 out of 18 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

This means you can sell a course using Strikingly's Simple Store, then create a page that is only visible to customers who bought that specific course.\nNote: There are two ways to create a membership course: a one-time payment, or a recurring payment. This walkthrough guides you on how to set up a one-time payment membership. For a recurring payment membership, please see this guide.\nThe Final Result:\nCheck out this sample site:\u00a0http://sellmycourses.mystrikingly.com/\nThis site offers 3 courses:1. Social Media Marketing2. Effective SEO Techniques 20193. Bundle Promo\nIf you purchase Social Media Marketing, your access is limited to that course only. The same is true for Effective SEO Techniques. However, if you purchase the Bundle Promo, you will both have access to the Social Media Marketing Course page and the Effective SEO Techniques page.\nTest out how it works by logging in to the site!\nAccess limited to Effective SEO Techniques course:Email: weare@happinessofficers.comInitial Password: zJbp4cm3gLFSYWj8\nBundle Promo Access:Email: support@strikingly.comInitial Password: I4fCaX5T7ZzIGR7N\nYou can do the same! Follow these steps:\nSet Up Your Store\nYou can use an existing site or create a new one.\n1. On your site editor, add a new section and select \"Simple Store\" from the section list.\n2. Set up your courses by adding products. Each product can correspond to one course. You can select the \"Service\" product type.\nActivate the membership feature\nWhen you're done setting up products, you are now ready to activate the membership feature! To do that, go to your Site Editor > Audience > Membership. Under Registration Method, choose \"Grant Membership to Store Customers\" and click \"Next\". Then, select the online courses that you set up earlier.\nAfter setting up your membership, you can now proceed to set up your members page where you can add your content for each course.\nCreate your members page\nYou should have multiple pages activated before you can set up your member-specific page.\n1. If you haven't activated multi-pages yet, click \"Activate Multiple Pages\" from Settings > Multiple Pages. 2. If you have activated that on your site already, click the \"Create a members-only page\" from the Membership settings page.\n3. Set up your new member's page name. Type the name of your new page. This new page will house the content for your course.\nIn this example, let's use \"Learn the Basics\" as the page name.\n4. Click the gear icon beside your new members' page, and set it as \"members-only\".\n5. On the next window, select \"Only registered members who purchased a specific product.\" Tie it to the course (product) that you want.\nWith this setting, only users who purchased \"Online Course #1\", will have access to the page \"Learn the Basics\" that you set up. You can set up different members' pages and tie them to different courses!\nPro Tip: You can set up bundled courses and get anyone who purchases them access to two or more different members-only pages!\n1. Set up a bundle course on your store.\n2. Tie course (product) to member pages it should have access to (bundled courses).\nWhat this setting means is that anyone who purchases the Spring Bundle Promo! and Online Course #1 will have access to the \"Learn the Basics\" page.\nYou don't have to set up a different members page for the \"Spring Bundle Promo\" product because you are offering two existing content into one course (or product).\n3. Add your content. The new member page that you created is empty. You can add videos, text, downloadable files, and more!\nNotes:\nIf you're going to add YouTube videos, make sure that these videos are set to \"Unlisted\". This way, only people who have the link will have access to your site and it will not be searchable on YouTube.\nAll files (PDF, documents, sheets, etc) that you upload on your members-only page will be secured. If anyone tries to access it via a direct link, it will not be accessible.\nTest out your new website!\nWhen you activate a membership on your site, we automatically create a test account so you can see what your site looks like to a member. To test different membership tiers, you can select a tier for your test account. Then, when you log into your live site using this test account, you'll see your site as if you're a member of that tier.\n__________________\nDid you know?\nYou can drive repeat customers using Strikingly's membership feature + coupons.

Now in your product editor, you can specify a weight for each product (in kg or lb). Then head to your shipping settings and specify a rule to calculate a shipping fee based on an order's total weight. You can even set different rules for different shipping regions. During checkout, our system will automatically compute the shipping cost and add it to the total price.\nSetting Up Product Weight\nGo to your site editor > Settings > Store > Products.\nIf you don't have a product yet, click \"Add New Product\". Add in your images, product description, and specify the weight of your product. If you have existing products, click \"Edit Product\".You should find the item weight under \"Shipping\". Make sure to tick the box beside \"Shipping info required from your customers?\" so the item weight appears!\u00a0If your product has variations, you can also use a different weight for each variation.\nClick \"Save\" when you're done. Once you add weight to your products, set up your shipping fee.\nSetting Up Shipping Fee per Weight\nGo to your editor > Settings > Store > Shipping > Add Shipping Option.\nUnder \"Shipping Rules\", click the dropdown and select \"By Order Weight\". On the next dropdown, you can choose between kilograms (kg) or pounds (lb) for your weight system.\nThere are two shipping fee options:A. Base cost + Per kg cost. This is the default option. You add base shipping cost, and fees for each additional kg/lb.\nBase cost - minimum shipping price\nPer kg/lb cost - shipping cost on top of the base cost per additional kg/lb\nB. By Weight Range. You can also choose to add weight ranges and a price for each range. To do that, follow these steps:\nClick the \"Edit weight ranges\" link in blue.\nSet your weight range and hit \u201cSave\u201d when you\u2019re done.\nAdd your shipping fee for each weight range that you created.\nClick the green \"Update\" button when you're done!\nPlease note that:\nYou can add up to 5 weight ranges only.\nThe weight range accepts up to 2 decimal points. If you input more than two decimal numbers, it will be rounded off.\nNegative numbers are not accepted.\nThe succeeding weight range will be 0.01 kg/lb higher than your previous range.\nYour shipping fee will be automatically computed on checkout and added to the total price.\nApplying Shipping Fee per Region\nYou can set different shipping fees for different regions. To add more regions, click the grey \u201cAdd Region\u201d button, select the region where you want to apply your next weight ranges, and follow the steps above (Setting Up Shipping Fee per Weight).\nYou can add up to 20 regions. But if you want a one shipping fee for overseas shipping, you can select \"The World/Rest of the World (if other regions are selected)\".\nShipping Fee Calculations\nA. Using Base Cost and Per kb/lb Cost\nThe formula used in calculating the shipping fee would be:\u00a0\u00a0base cost + (per kg cost x order weight)\nFor example:\nIf your order weighs 0.5kg, then the shipping fee will be computed as:\u00a0$10.00 + ($5.00 x 0.5 kg) = $12.50 (shipping fee)\nHowever, if your order weighs 2.75 kg, then the shipping fee will be computed as $10.00 + ($5.00 x 2.75 kg) = $23.75 (shipping fee)\nIf your customers buy 3 products with a total weight of 3.17 kg, it will be computed as follows: $10.00 + ($5.00 x 3.17 kg) = $25.85 (shipping fee)\nB. Shipping Fee Using Weight Range\nWhen weight ranges are set, the shipping fee will be based on the price that you set per range.\nFor example:\nIf your order weighs 1 kg and you're shipping it to the United States, the shipping fee will be $5.00.\nOn the other hand, if your order weighs 2.25 kg and you're shipping to Canada, the cost will be $11.00.\nBut if your customers buy 2 products with a total weight of 12 kg, here's how the shipping fee will be computed:\n(if shipping to the United States) $7.00 + ((12 kg - 4.00 kg) x $1.00) = $15.00\n(if shipping to Canada) $12.00 + ((12 kg - 4.00 kg) x $1.00 = $20.00\nThat's it!

After you activate the membership, you'll be able to create members-only pages. You'll need to activate Multiple Pages to do so.\nAudience Plan (optional). An Audience Plan is an add-on plan, added on top of any Limited, Pro, or VIP plan, that expands the total memberships you can accept.

To learn more about the Audience Plan and how it powers the Membership feature, click here.\nNote: The maximum number of members allowed is related to the available active contacts you have on your account. Refer to this article for more details.\nSelect Registration Method\nGo to your Site Editor > Audience > Membership, choose the type of membership you want, and click \"Next\".\nYou can control how your site visitors can become members on your website by selecting the registration method through the initial membership page or create a membership tier popup. You have three options:\n1. Free Membership. Anyone who visits your website can freely sign up to become a member.\n2. Paid Subscription Membership. A visitor must pay a monthly fee to become a member! Great for selling content or an ongoing service. Members will be billed automatically each month. View more details here: https://support.strikingly.com/hc/en-us/articles/900000294186-Paid-Subscription-Membership\n3.

All sections will be available for you to add!\nManaging Your Members\nAs the site owner, you will have the power to manage your own members, and invite old contacts to become members.\nInviting Old Contacts to Become Members\nTo invite old contacts to become members, go to your Audience tab.\n1. Select the contact that you want to invite.\n2. Click the Member Options button and select \"Grant Membership\".\nWhen you do this, the user will receive an email with a login URL.

Reset their password. Clicking this option will send a password reset email to your selected contact. The password is randomly generated, but they can change it after they log in.\n2.

The tiers will be listed in the same order that they were configured in your store's Membership settings.\nNote: \"Buy Product to Register\" tiers will not be shown here, since the visitor must buy an item from the store to gain membership.\nNote: Even if your customers cancel the checkout or\u00a0the initial payment failed, they will\u00a0have a free membership. In this case, they can begin a subscription via the \"My Account\" menu in your live site.\n2. View Subscription in My Account\nYour members are able to view their subscription details in the \"My Account\" menu after logging into your site. They can also cancel anytime.\nDisable Membership Login\n1. Go to your Site Editor > Audience > Membership, and click \"Disable Membership\".\nBy disabling membership, the Login button will be removed from your site navigation, along with all membership pages.

The GDPR aims to strengthen the security and protection of personal data in the EU and harmonize EU data protection law.\nWhy is GDPR important?\nThe GDPR has the potential to impact any business that collects data in or from Europe. One of the key aspects of the GDPR is that it creates consistency across EU member states on how personal data can be processed, used, and exchanged securely. If you collect, change, transmit, erase, or otherwise use or store the personal data of EU citizens, you\u2019ll need to comply with the GDPR.\nIf you are a website owner and collect personal data via web forms, especially from people who live in the European Union, you'll need to make your website compliant with this regulation, come on May 25, 2018. It is also important that you update your site's Privacy Policy to cover all personal information that is being collected through your site.\nWhat and who?\nThe GDPR applies to all organizations operating in the EU and processing \u201cpersonal identifiable data\u201d of EU residents. Personal data is any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. e.g., dates of birth, names, physical addresses, email addresses, and so on.\nAbout Consent\nYou need to have a legal basis, like consent, to process an EU citizen\u2019s personal data.\u00a0This consent must be verifiable. It requires a written record of when and how\u00a0someone agreed to let you process their personal data.\nAbout Individual Rights\nThe GDPR also outlines the rights of individuals around their personal data. EU citizens will have the right to ask for details about the way you use their personal data, and can ask you to do certain things with that data. People have the right to request their personal data be corrected, provided to them, prohibited for certain users, or removed completely.\nHow Does Strikingly Protect Your Data and Comply with GDPR?\nStrikingly is dedicated to protecting your data and complying with GDPR policies when it becomes enforceable on May 25, 2018. Our team is working with users around the world to answer their questions and to help them prepare for using Strikingly\u2019s Services when GDPR takes effect.\nOur team has reviewed Strikingly\u2019s product features and practices to ensure we support GDPR compliance requirements. This document provides a description of our practices and policies.\n1. User Information\nStrikingly contracts security consultants to ensure the security of our user information. They perform regular security audits and infiltration testing to maintain our ISO/PCI security certifications. Any issues that are reported to our security team or raised during security audits are resolved as soon as possible.\nStrikingly encrypts databases containing sensitive information, according to PCI standards, to add additional protection of personally identifiable information. Our encryption methods render this information unreadable without a cryptographic key.\nStrikingly has a multiple-layer security architecture to help protect against 0-day security issues.\nStrikingly's signup, login, and payment services are completed through a secure server. The information provided to Strikingly in the signup process is secured via HTTPS/ SSL communication.\nStrikingly uses cryptography hash functions to protect users\u2019 information. User\u2019s password is stored as a hash digest and, in the event of a security breach, their original password cannot be recovered from our servers.\n2. Data Security\nStrikingly has documented and implemented internal mechanisms for limiting the processing of personal data to only certain specified uses relating to Strikingly\u2019s products and services.\nStrikingly only discloses Service Data to third parties where disclosures are necessary to provide the services or as required to respond to lawful requests from public authorities.\nStrikingly uses multiple data centers to guarantee a secure and highly available service at scale.\n3. Transparent Terms\nStrikingly makes Terms & Conditions, and Privacy Policy clear and transparent to our users.\n4. Data Processing\nStrikingly publishes Data Processing Agreement (DPA), to address how we process data on users' behalf.\n5. Internal Protocol\nWe continuously train employees on best security practices, including how to identify social engineering, phishing scams, and hackers.\nEmployees on teams that have access to customer data (such as tech support and our engineers) undergo criminal history and credit background checks before employment.\nAll employees sign a Privacy Safeguard Agreement outlining their responsibility in protecting customer data.\nWhen a Strikingly employee leaves the company, we follow a strict checklist to ensure that all of their server access permissions are revoked.\n6. Data Access Rights\nRequest to view data: Strikingly provides users the right to access their data, check what data we have collected, and choose their data to be forgotten.\nRequest to delete data: Strikingly provides data subjects with the right to delete data if the continued processing is not justified. For example, users may need to delete their customers' and site visitors' personal data to comply with GDPR obligations. Users may also delete their accounts, which will permanently remove relevant data from our servers.\nWhat Third-Party Data Services Does Strikingly Use?\nAs a website editor and hosting service, we collect data to better serve your needs and continuously improve our product.\u00a0In the Strikingly dashboard and editor, we log user event data to Mixpanel.\u00a0This data is anonymized and contains no Personally Identifiable Information (PII).\u00a0On published Strikingly websites, we log data to Google Analytics and Keen.io to record site visit data. This data is anonymized and contains no Personally Identifiable Information (PII).\nTo view more detailed information about the data we collect, please see our Privacy Policy.\nHow Do I Make My Strikingly Websites Compliant?\nIf your website is targeting users in the European Union, you should enable GDPR for your own sites. Visit the following link to learn how.\nEnable GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) Compliance for Your Website on Strikingly\nResources\nRegulators within the European Union provide specific guidance on GDPR policies.

These chats are connected to your visitor's Facebook Messenger account, so they'll always have access to it. Here's what your visitors will see on your site:\nYou'll need:\nA Pro Strikingly account.\nA Strikingly site connected to a custom domain with HTTPS (learn how here).\nA Facebook Page (make one here: https://www.facebook.com/pages/create).\nA Facebook App ID (how to get one: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/register).\nGot all that? Great, let's get to it!\n1. Get your Facebook App ID.\nThis is a long number. For example, Strikingly's own App ID is 138736958550286. You will see your App ID on this page:\u00a0https://developers.facebook.com/apps/.\n2. Get your Facebook Page ID.\nThis is another long number. For example, Strikingly's Page ID is 211998345516663. To find your Page ID, go to your Facebook Page, and follow the next steps:\nClick the\u00a0About\u00a0tab below your Page's cover photo, then click\u00a0Page transparency.\nClick\u00a0See all, then click\u00a0Go to Ad Library.\nFind\u00a0view_all_page_id=\u00a0in the address bar of your browser. Your Page ID is the number immediately following this.\n3. In your Facebook Page Admin Settings, go to \"Messenger Platform\", and add your domain to the whitelist (must use https!).\nClick save when you're done! Here's what it looks like:\n4. Add Custom Code to your Strikingly site.\nPaste the following code into Settings > Advanced > Custom Code > Footer Code. Make sure to\u00a0REPLACE the red bolded parts with your own Facebook App ID and Facebook Page ID!\n<script>\u00a0 window.fbAsyncInit = function() {\u00a0 \u00a0 FB.init({\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 appId : 'YOUR_APP_ID',\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 autoLogAppEvents : true,\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 xfbml : true,\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 version : 'v2.11'\u00a0 \u00a0 });\u00a0 };\u00a0 (function(d, s, id){\u00a0 var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\u00a0 if (d.getElementById(id)) {return;}\u00a0 js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;\u00a0 js.src = \"https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk/xfbml.customerchat.js\";;\u00a0 fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);\u00a0 }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));</script><div class=\"fb-customerchat\" messenger_app_id=\"YOUR_APP_ID\" page_id=\"YOU_PAGE_ID\" ref=\"test\"></div>\n5.

This way, everyone can enjoy your services, access data from your website, or enjoy your work.\nTo improve your site's accessibility, here are a few tips:\n1. Choose the right template. We've created strikingly beautiful templates that are accessible and fit your needs. You can choose your template from our Discover Page.\n2. Add alt-text to your images. Visually impaired people might use assistive software to browse through your website. You can add your image descriptions via alt-text to help this software \"read\" them.\n| Pro Tip! JAWS, a popular screen reader, limits image descriptions at 125 characters. Keep it short and simple!\n3. Use clear and easy-to-read fonts. Fonts play a critical part in your overall website design. We have several fonts available for you to choose from. While some fonts are more legible than others, pick one that doesn't compromise your style.\n| Pro Tip!\u00a0Use text blocks to create content, instead of adding text to your images.\n4. Take advantage of header tags. Your site's headings will help visitors with screen readers easily navigate your content and find the information that they need.\n5. Use a color contrast ratio of 4.5:1. This should help visually impaired visitors distinguish, say, foreground and background colors on your website. You can also use third-party applications like Color Oracle to simulate how people with visual impairments view your website.

Strikingly, ICANN and the applicable registries shall not be liable for any lost profits, revenues, or data, financial losses, or indirect, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages. Because some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such states, liability is limited to the extent permitted by law.\n19. INDEMNITY.

You explicitly authorize Strikingly to act as Designated Agent, as stipulated by the ICANN Transfer Policy, to approve a Change of Registrant on Your behalf.\n21. BREACH. You agree that failure to abide by any provision of this Agreement, any ICANN, Registry, URDP, or Dispute operating rule or policy, may be considered by Strikingly to be a material breach and that Strikingly may provide a written notice, describing the breach, to You. If within fifteen (15) calendar days of the date of such notice, You fail to provide evidence, which is reasonably satisfactory to Strikingly, that You have not breached its obligations under the Agreement, then Strikingly may delete the registration of the domain name. Any such breach by You shall not be deemed to be excused simply because Strikingly did not act earlier in response to that, or any other, breach by You.\n22. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES. Except for the express warranties in this Agreement, \u00a0Strikingly does not make any other warranty of any kind, whether express, implied, statutory, or otherwise, including warranties or merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

Strikingly shall implement appropriate safeguards to protect the Personal Data, wherever it is processed, in accordance with the requirements of Data Protection Laws.\n6.2 Transfer Mechanism. Notwithstanding Section 6.1, to the extent, Strikingly processes or transfers (directly or via onward transfer) Personal Data under this DPA from the European Union, the European Economic Area and/or their member states and Switzerland (\u201cEU Data\u201d) in or to countries which do not ensure an adequate level of data protection within the meaning of applicable Data Protection Laws of the foregoing territories, the parties agree that Strikingly shall be deemed to provide appropriate safeguards for such data. Customer hereby authorizes any transfer of EU Data to, or access to EU Data from, such destinations outside the EU subject to any of these measures having been taken.\n7. Additional Security\n7.1 \u00a0Confidentiality of processing.\u00a0Strikingly shall ensure that any person who is authorized by Strikingly to process Customer Data (including its staff, agents, and subcontractors) shall be under an appropriate obligation of confidentiality (whether a contractual or statutory duty).\n7.2 \u00a0Security Incident Response.\u00a0Upon becoming aware of a Security Incident, Strikingly shall notify the Customer without undue delay and shall provide timely information relating to the Security Incident as it becomes known or as is reasonably requested by the Customer.\n8. Deletion of Data\nUpon termination of the Agreement, Strikingly shall (at Customer's election) delete Customer Data (including copies) in its possession or control, save that this requirement shall not apply to the extent Strikingly is required by the applicable law to retain some or all of the Customer Data, or to Customer Data it has archived on backup systems, which Customer Data Strikingly shall securely isolate and protect from any further processing, except to the extent required by applicable law.\n9. Cooperation\n9.1 The Services provide Customer with a number of controls that Customer may use to retrieve, correct, delete or restrict Customer Data, which Customer may use to assist it in connection with its obligations under the GDPR, including its obligations relating to responding to requests from data subjects or applicable data protection authorities. To the extent that Customer is unable to independently access the relevant Customer Data within the Services, Strikingly shall (at Customer's expense) provide reasonable cooperation to assist Customer to respond to any requests from individuals or applicable data protection authorities relating to the processing of Personal Data under the Agreement. In the event that any such request is made directly to Strikingly, Strikingly shall not respond to such communication directly without Customer's prior authorization, unless legally compelled to do so. If Strikingly is required to respond to such a request, Strikingly shall promptly notify Customer and provide it with a copy of the request unless legally prohibited from doing so.\n9.2 If a law enforcement agency sends Strikingly a demand for Customer Data (for example, through a subpoena or court order), Strikingly shall attempt to redirect the law enforcement agency to request that data directly from the Customer. As part of this effort, Strikingly may provide the Customer\u2019s basic contact information to the law enforcement agency. If compelled to disclose Customer Data to a law enforcement agency, then Strikingly shall give Customer reasonable notice of the demand to allow Customer to seek a protective order or another appropriate remedy, unless Strikingly is legally prohibited from doing so.\n9.3 To the extent Strikingly is required under EU Data Protection Law, Strikingly shall (at Customer's expense) provide reasonably requested information regarding the Services to enable the Customer to carry out data protection impact assessments or prior consultations with data protection authorities as required by law.\nIn case you need assistance, shoot us a line at\u00a0support@strikingly.com\u00a0or\u00a0chat\u00a0with us.\nWas this article helpful?\n0 out of 1 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

Your email will be initially set to pending status as our system creates your email address.\n6. After a few minutes, your email will be ready and login information will be sent to your selected email address.\n7. Go to your email address you entered during registration. The email will contain the following:\nLogin URL\nEmail Account/Username\nPassword (system generated for your security)\nYou can find the login URL from your Email dashboard as well.\nThis is what the webmail looks like.\nNote: Strikingly Email currently offers only one theme, and it cannot be changed.\nYou can also use an email client to send and receive your email:\nWindows Mail (Windows 8/8.1)\nWindows Mail (Windows 10)\nAndroid Phone\niPhone\nGmail\nThunderbird\nOther Mail Clients\nIf you'd like to receive all emails sent to your MyStrikingly email to your other inbox, you can set up email forwarding.\nMore about Strikingly Emails:\nStrikingly Email: Managing Email Accounts\nStrikingly Email: Changing Password\nStrikingly Email: Creating Your Email Signature\nStrikingly Email: Email Attachment Size Limit and Storage Limit\nStrikingly Email: Setting Up an Email Autoresponder\nIn case you need assistance, contact us at\u00a0support@strikingly.com\u00a0or\u00a0chat with us.\nWas this article helpful?\n8 out of 9 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

When your visitors hover over the dropdown title, a menu containing either links to pages on your site or links to external sites will expand.\nPlease note that visitors will not be able to click on the dropdown title itself, only the items in the expanded menu.\nStep 1: Enabling the Dropdown Menu\nThe dropdown menu option is only available to multi-page sites. You can enable the multiple-page functionality in your site's Settings panel \u00a0- see our guide to creating a multi-page site here.\nUnder your page manager, open the \"ADVANCED>\" option and click the [Add Dropdown Menu] button.\nYou'll see that a new dropdown item has been added - you can add up to 10 dropdown menus in one site.\nStep 2: Name and Reposition\u00a0the Dropdown Menu\nNow, rename the dropdown and drag the menu\u00a0to the right order in the navigation menu. Please note that you will not be able to replace the homepage with a dropdown menu. The first item in the navigation menu must be a page (and not a dropdown menu or external link).\nStep 3: Add Items\u00a0to the Dropdown Menu\nYou can add up to 15 items (either pages or external links) to a single dropdown menu by dragging and dropping the pages or external links under the menu.\nCreating a Dropdown Menu for Sections\nIf you want to create a dropdown menu that links to the sections of a page (rather than individual pages), use the external link functionality. Start off with a new dropdown menu.\nAdd the link to the section by adding a new external link. For example, to create a dropdown item that links to the second section of this page http://sunnysideup.strikingly.com/photos, click [Add New link] under EXTERNAL LINKS and put the URL or select the page and section you want to link to.\nNext, move the external links to the dropdown menu. In this dropdown, \"Nature\" links to the first section of this page http://sunnysideup.strikingly.com/photos, and \"Urban\" links to the second section on the same page.\nLastly, hide the original page that the sections are on by unchecking the \"Show in navigation\" option in the settings gear and publish your changes.\nAfter setting up the external links to sections in the dropdown menu, it will look like this:\nNote: Currently, we only support dropdowns for the navigation bar. We do not support dropdowns for the footer.\nWe hope you'll find this feature useful! Please let us know if you have any\u00a0questions by emailing us at support@strikingly.com\u00a0or chatting with us.

If so, and you\u2019d like to use your Google AdSense ad code with your Strikingly site or blog, you can check the following instructions.\nWhat type of Ad Units can be used?\nDisplay Ad Unit - We recommend this type as our websites are responsive as well. By choosing this size and setting its size as responsive, ads will automatically fit the page/section, depending on the screen size of the device used to view the site.\nAuto Ads - Allows you to use a single set of code that would work for the entire site.\nHow to Create a Display Ad Unit in Google AdSense\nLogin to your Google AdSense account and click Ads > By ad unit > Display Ads.\nName your ad. Any name will do. It could be anything you can think of that would let you easily tell where you put the code in. Leave \"Ad size\" set to \"Responsive\" so the ad would resize to auto-fit the screen of any device.\nCopy the code and paste it into a notepad.\nHow to add the Ad unit code to a Strikingly site\nGo to your site editor and click \u201cAdd new section\u201d.\nPick the \u201cEmbed & HTML\u201d section.\nHover over the newly added section, click \u201cEdit\u201d and select \u201cHTML\u201d from the available apps.\nPaste the Google Adsense code you copied earlier into the box, then hit \u201cSave\u201d.\nPreview your site to see how it looks on PC.\nNote: The preview for tablet and mobile will not automatically resize the ad unit as technically, the site preview is still being viewed on a larger screen (laptop or PC). The ad unit will look cropped.

The code is added to a site only once and updates automatically when the ad setting is changed. These will work on any page on a multiple-page site, and this type of ad works on mobile.Note:\u00a0If you have previously installed Page-level ads code, there is no need to generate and paste your ad code again, as both Page-level ads and Auto ads use the same ad code.\nHow to enable Auto ads:\nNote: This option requires a custom domain linked to your site and listed on Google AdSense. Here's a guide about it.\nSign in to your Google AdSense account and click Ads.\nIn the table of all your sites, click Edit\u00a0\u00a0next to your site. Your site opens in the\u00a0ad settings preview.\nUnder \"Ad settings\", turn on\u00a0Auto ads.\nClick\u00a0Apply to site.\nChoose your save option:\nClick\u00a0Apply now > \u00a0Save, to immediately apply your Auto ads settings to your site.\nClick\u00a0Run experiment first >\u00a0Run experiment, to test your Auto ads settings.\nYour auto ads should appear on your site within 10 to 20 minutes.\nHow it looks on mobile:\nIn case you need assistance, shoot us a line at\u00a0support@strikingly.com\u00a0or\u00a0chat with us.\nWas this article helpful?\n4 out of 4 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

In our example, the image already has the text and call-to-action button included within the image itself.\nAfter uploading your image as the background, you can add a link to the slider to make the entire slider clickable.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat are the recommended dimensions for the Banner Slider image?We recommend\u00a0uploading an image that's 1600 pixels wide by 600 pixels - but the section height expands and collapses to the height of the image you upload.\n*Note: It's best to use the exact dimensions for all the images uploaded into the banner section.\nHow many banner slides can I add?You can add up to 20 slides for each banner section.How will\u00a0the banner slider look on mobile devices?The banner image will resize automatically to show the entire banner image - so it's best to upload images where the text isn't too small to optimize for mobile visitors.\nCan I make a site completely out of banner image sliders?Yes, you can, but we discourage this practice. Although the banner section gives you a lot of flexibility in how you can design a section, creating a site entirely of banner sections will be bad for your site's search engine ranking because search engines won't be able to find text on your site.\nDon't hesitate to drop us a line at support@strikingly.com or chat with us if you have any questions!\nWas this article helpful?\n5 out of 5 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

To use jQuery in custom code, you must use _strk.\nInstead of placing your jQuery code directly in the header or footer, you must\u00a0subscribe to the page load event and then run the code there:\n<script>_strk.push('Page.didMount', function(){\n/* your jQuery code goes here */\n})</script>\nThe full custom code should\u00a0look something like this:\n<script>\n_strk.push('Page.didMount', function(){\n$(\".s-section-1 h1\").text(Math.random())\n})\n</script>\nOn the other hand, if you do not use _strk, this code will NOT work:\n<script>/* This jQuery code will NOT work */\n$(\".s-section-1 h1\").text(Math.random())\n</script>\nNote: _strk\u00a0works in both site custom code and blog custom code.\nWas this article helpful?\n3 out of 3 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

If you are still using this browser version, you will see a pop-up message. Here's what the message looks like:\nWe recommend using the latest browser version available for your operating system.\nPlease also take note:\nIf you're using Safari or Internet Explorer, the version will depend on your operating system. For instance, if you're on Windows 10, you use Microsoft Edge.\nIf you're editing your website, browser add-ons or extensions can interfere. We\u00a0may ask you to disable these when we troubleshoot for issues.\nHow you see your site may vary depending on what browser you use.\nIf you notice that there's a little discrepancy between how you view your sites in different browsers, don't panic! That is perfectly normal since each browser uses different technologies. As a recommendation, we'd recommend that you enable JavaScript when viewing and editing your site to avoid any further issues.\nPlugin issues:\nIf you click on the Register and Sign in buttons or if you're trying to edit your site and receive no response, this is a sign that a plugin or add-on installed on your browser is interfering with your access to Strikingly. Certain plugins intended to preserve your privacy, such as uBlock/Adblock, will prevent you from registering or signing in to Strikingly. Generally, you should be able to work around this by adding strikingly.com to your browser add-on's white list. Or you can disable the browser add-on that may have been causing these issues.\nWas this article helpful?

(If viewing on a monitor, the top and bottom of the image may be cropped. If viewing on a phone in portrait mode, the left and right sides of the image may be cropped.)\nFor a more optimized background setting, an image dimension of 1600 x 900 px should do nicely.\nKeep this in mind when you upload background images with content in them (faces, text, etc). If your background images contain content, it's best to keep it in the center of the image and ensure enough space on the edges so cropping won't cut off your content. Another method is to upload the content as an image on top of the background, but this is only doable with specific sections.\nIt's also possible to alter your background image's positioning/scaling settings.\u00a0If you need to display the entire image, try setting the scale option to \"Contain\".If you want the entire section to be covered by the image all the time, try \"Stretch\".\nLearn more at Backgrounds & Image Settings.\nIn case you need assistance, shoot us a line at support@strikingly.com or chat\u00a0with us.\nWas this article helpful?\n4 out of 4 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

Search engines take time to examine and index your site, and thus it takes time for SEO to increase or for links listed to change. They know what the \"tricks\" are. Keep in mind it depends on various factors including content, descriptions, link-backs, host, URL, and more!\nNote: When you switch to and from websites (content or URL), your SEO may be refreshed as well, so you may have to work on these elements again.\n1. Write a descriptive title\nThe title of your site is what shows up in the tab at the top of your browser, address bar, search engine results, and social shares. This is like the front door of your page. Make it attractive!\nFor example, \"Johnny's Bakery - Freshly Baked every day in San Francisco\" is much better than \"Johnny's Shop.\"Visit Changing Site/Page Title and read more from Google: Create descriptive page titles.\n2. Add site and page meta descriptions\nAdd a description to your site and every page. The meta description (meta tags) is the snippet that summarizes the site's content on the search engine results page - and adding it to your site is very important for improving your site's search engine ranking.\nHowever, be careful not to include keywords just for the sake of increasing your ranking, as many search engines demote this behavior (keyword stuffing) and rank you lower.\nGood description: \"Johnny's Bakery is a gourmet bakery and confectionery based in the Mission in San Francisco. We started in 1965 and we've been offering delightful bread, cakes, pies, and cookies to happy customers ever since!\"\n3. Add keywords to your headings\nHeadings are the big text boxes that are located throughout your site. Titles are important for SEO because search engines give additional weight to heading text. So, it's better to add descriptive text in the headings.\nFor instance, \"About Johnny's Bakery\" is better than \"About\" as a heading for your \"About\" section.\nTo learn more, visit Adding Heading Tags (H1, H2...) and Adding Keywords (Search Phrases) for SEO.\n4. Produce high-quality content\nContent is king. Do keyword research and write content that is recent, valuable, helpful, and relevant for the visitors. The higher the quality of content, the higher the website will be ranked by search engines.\nAdding a blog to your site is a great way to help search engines see your site as active and good for your business. Updating your blog regularly with relevant and high-quality content can benefit your SEO, gain visitors, and build your brand. Learn more.\n5. Add descriptions to all images\nSince search engines don't understand images, they look for image descriptions. An image description will help search engines index your image, which helps index your site.\u00a0Also, try to keep your image sizes under 200KB. The best size for website images (desktop and laptop) is around 50KB. This will improve performance and experience!\n6. Connect a domain to your Strikingly site\nConnecting yourname.com or yourcompany.com strengthens your brand and helps potential visitors find your site. Visit Connecting a Domain to Your Strikingly Site. If you want to use a Strikingly Free URL, your\u00a0https://xxx.mystrikingly.com URL has good SEO and loads quickly as well!\n7. Actively share your site on other websites\nA huge part of search engine ranking comes from backlinks and traffic. That means the more sites that link to your site, and the higher the quality of those sites, the better your search engine ranking will be.\nStart posting your site on blogs, forums, and social media! Create a Google Plus profile, if relevant. Include your URL in your LinkedIn profile, email signature, and other networks. Find the places where people are interested in what you do and share!\n8. Verify your site with Google Search Console\nGoogle Search Console is a free service that helps your site find on Google quicker! To learn more, visit\u00a0Verifying Google Search Console and Submitting Sitemap.\n9. Use Strikingly built-in analytics\nCheck which pages get you traffic, where your visitors are coming from, and more. Visit Using Your Strikingly Built-in Analytics.\n10.

ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS\nWelcome to Strikingly, Inc.'s website creation service (the \"Service\"). Your use of the Service is subject to these Terms of Service (\"Terms\"). These Terms will also be applicable to your use of the Service on a trial basis. By using the Service, you signify your acceptance of these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Service.\n2. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE\nOur web-based Service allows users who register for an account (each an \"Account Holder\") to create and update an online website. Once registered, each Account Holder receives his or her own Web Site and may post \"Content\" (defined in Section 7). Any new features on the Service, including the release of new Strikingly tools and resources, shall be subject to these Terms. To use the Service, you must have access to the Internet, either directly or through devices that access web-based content, and you must pay any fees associated with Internet access. In addition, you must provide all equipment necessary to make such a connection to the Internet, including a web-enabled computer. The Service may include certain communications from us, such as service announcements, administrative messages, and the Strikingly Newsletter. These communications are considered part of Strikingly membership. You may not access the Service by any means other than through the Service interfaces we provide you.\n3. REGISTRATION\nTo register as an Account Holder, you must provide us with a valid email address and other information (\"Registration Data\"). You will choose a password and account designation for your websites during the registration process and you will obtain a Strikingly ID. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the password and account, and for all activities that occur under your account. In consideration of the use of the Service, you agree to maintain and update true, accurate, current, and complete Registration Data. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current, or incomplete, or if Strikingly has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current, or incomplete, we may suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Service or any portion thereof.\n4. CANCELLATION AND TERMINATION\nIf you cancel the Service, your cancellation will take effect immediately. After cancellation, you will no longer have access to your website and we may delete all information on your website. We accept no liability for such deleted information or content. For as long as we continue to offer the Service, we will provide and seek to update, improve and expand the Service. As a result, we allow you to access the Service as it may exist and be available on any given day and have no other obligations, except as expressly stated in this Agreement. We may modify, replace, refuse access to, suspend, or discontinue the Service, partially or entirely, or change and modify prices for all or part of the Services for you or for all our users in our sole discretion. All of these changes shall be effective upon their posting on our site or by direct communication to you unless otherwise noted. We further reserve the right to withhold, remove and or discard any Content available as part of your account, with or without notice if deemed by us to be contrary to this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, we have no obligation to store, maintain or provide you a copy of any content that you or others provide when using the Service.\n5. STRIKINGLY PRIVACY POLICY\nHow we collect, protect, and use your Registration Data and certain other information about you are contained in our Privacy Policy, which is part of these Terms.\n6. WEBSITE ACCOUNT AND SECURITY\nYou are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and website, for all activities that occur or actions taken under the account or in connection with the website.

We will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation. You acknowledge and agree that under no circumstances will we be liable, in any way, for any of your acts or omissions or those of any third party, including damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions.\n7.

This permission exists only for as long as you continue to use the Service or remain an Account Holder.\n8.

(\"Tucows\") and you, on behalf of yourself or the entity you represent (\"Registrant\"), as offered through __________________ ___________________________, the Reseller participating in Tucows' distribution channel for domain name registrations. Any reference to \"Registry\" or \"Registry Operator\" shall refer to the registry administrator of the applicable top-level domain (\"TLD\"). This Agreement explains Tucows' obligations to Registrant, and Registrant's obligations to Tucows, for the domain registration services. By agreeing to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, Registrant agrees to be bound by the rules and regulations set forth in this Agreement, and by a registry for that particular TLD.\nDOMAIN NAME REGISTRATION.\u00a0Domain name registrations are for a limited term, which ends on the expiration date communicated to the Registrant. A domain name submitted through Tucows will be deemed active when the relevant registry accepts the Registrant's application and activates Registrant's domain name registration or renewal. Tucows cannot guarantee that Registrant will obtain a desired domain name, even if an inquiry indicates that a domain name is available at the time of application. Tucows is not responsible for any inaccuracies or errors in the domain name registration or renewal process.\nFEES. The registrant agrees to pay Reseller the applicable service fees prior to the registration or renewal of a domain. All fees payable here under are non-refundable even if Registrant's domain name registration is suspended, canceled, or transferred prior to the end of your current registration term.\nTERM. This Agreement will remain in effect during the term of the domain name registration as selected, recorded, and paid for at the time of registration or renewal. Should the domain name be transferred to another registrar, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall cease.\nEXPIRATION, RENEWAL, AND FORFEITURE. The registered domain name will expire on the expiration date specified in the registration term, and as communicated to the Registrant. The registrant will receive reminders immediately prior to the expiration inviting Registrant to renew the domain name. In the event that Registrant fails to renew the domain name in a timely fashion, the registration will expire and Tucows may, at its discretion, elect to assume the registration and may hold it in its own account, delete it, or sell it to a third party. During the period following the expiration of a domain name, the domain name will cease to resolve, the Whois registration records may be revised to include that of Tucows or its reseller, and visitors to the Registrant's website may be directed to a default web page. This default web page may feature advertisements posted by Tucows for its own account. Registrant acknowledges and agrees that Registrant's right and interest in a domain name ceases upon its expiration. The registrant is solely responsible for informing itself of the date of expiration and renewing its registration in a timely manner. If Tucows, in its sole discretion, elects to renew the registration, Registrant will be entitled to a grace period of forty (40) days during which the Registrant may re-register the domain name. Additional costs for the redemption and re-registration will apply.\nEXPIRED REGISTRATION RECOVERY POLICY.\u00a0Domain expiration notices will be sent via email thirty (30) days and five (5) days prior to a domain expiration date and three (3) days after a domain expires. Renewal, post-expiration renewal, and redemptions fees are published at https://opensrs.com/services/domains/domain-pricing/. Reseller's fees may differ.\nREGISTRANT INFORMATION AND DATA_SHARING.\u00a0Data required for the registration of a domain name varies by top-level domain.

Further, Registrant represents and warrants that, if the Registrant is providing information about a third party, the Registrant has notified the third party of the required disclosures and the purpose for the disclosures and the Registrant has obtained the third party's consent to such disclosure.

In the event a domain name dispute arises, Registrant will indemnify and hold Tucows harmless pursuant to the terms and conditions contained in the applicable policy. If Tucows is notified that a complaint has been filed with a judicial or administrative body regarding a domain name, Tucows may, at its sole discretion, suspend the use of the domain name and the ability to make modifications to the registration records until:\nTucows is directed to do so by the judicial or administrative body, or\nTucows receives notification from both parties that the dispute has been settled.\nIf Registrant or Registrant's domain name becomes the subject of litigation, Tucows may deposit control of the Registrant's domain name record into the registry of the judicial body by supplying a party with a registrar certificate.\nWHOIS PRIVACY SERVICE.

Tucows, ICANN, and the applicable registries shall not be liable for any lost profits, revenues, or data, financial losses, or indirect, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages. Because some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such states, liability is limited to the extent permitted by law.\nINDEMNITY.\u00a0Registrant will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Tucows, ICANN, the applicable registries, and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, affiliates, and contractors, from all liabilities, claims, and expenses, including attorney's fees, arising out of or relating to\nRegistrant's registration and use of the domain name registered;\nuse of the domain name in violation of this Agreement; or\nRegistrant's violation of any third-party right, including Intellectual Property Rights.

The person named as Registrant on record with Tucows shall be the \"Registered Name Holder.\" If designated, the person named as administrative contact at the time the controlling account was secured shall be deemed the designate of the Registrant with the authority to manage the domain name. Registrant agrees that prior to transferring ownership of the domain name to another person (the \"Transferee\") Registrant shall require the Transferee to agree, in writing to be bound by all the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If the Transferee fails to be bound in a reasonable fashion (as determined by Tucows in its sole discretion) to the terms and conditions in this Agreement, any such transfer will be null and void.

Registrant agrees that failure to abide by any provision of this Agreement, any ICANN, Registry, URDP, or Dispute operating rule or policy, may be considered by Tucows to be a material breach, and that Tucows may provide a written notice, describing the breach, to Registrant. If within fifteen (15) calendar days of the date of such notice, Registrant fails to provide evidence, which is reasonably satisfactory to Tucows, that Registrant has not breached its obligations under the Agreement, then Tucows may delete the registration of the domain name. Any such breach by Registrant shall not be deemed to be excused simply because Tucows did not act earlier in response to that, or any other, breach by Registrant.\nDISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES. Except for the express warranties in this Agreement, Tucows does not make any other warranty of any kind, whether express, implied, statutory, or otherwise, including warranties or merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

In the event that this Agreement may be inconsistent with any term, condition, policy, or procedure of an applicable Registry, the term, condition, policy, or procedure of the applicable Registry shall prevail.\nNON-WAIVER.

Please be aware that the renewal process is automatic, and the payment will be processed using the payment method associated with your Strikingly account.\nThe only way to prevent the email account from renewing is to Delete Email Account.

You must upgrade to a Limited, Pro, or VIP plan (if you haven't yet) to connect your domain.\nBefore You Register\nIf you're within the first year of the Strikingly paid plan, you're eligible for one free custom domain (worth $24.95).\nIf you're on a trial or a monthly plan, or if you want multiple domains, you will need to pay for the domains per year.\nDomains purchased through Strikingly start at US$24.95 per year. The exact pricing depends on which top-level domain (TLD) extension you choose, such as .com, .org, or .net. You can check the price and availability of your domain by searching your domain dashboard.\nStrikingly Domains are\u00a0set to renew and charge automatically each year\u00a07 days before the expiration date.\nOnce you connect your domain, we'll automatically hook the domain up to your site, so you won't need to manage domain settings.\nDomains purchased through Strikingly include domain privacy.\nYou can't change your domain names after registering/purchasing.\nDomain registrations/purchases are non-refundable.\nIf you are ready to proceed, follow these steps:\nStep 1: Choose Your Own Domain\nIf you are on your site editor\nIf you are on your dashboard\nStep 2: Fill in Your Personal Information\nStep 3: Verify Your Domain Ownership via Email (very important)\nStep 4: Connect Your Strikingly Domain to Your Site\nStep 5: Wait for the Records to Take Effect\nStep 1: Choose Your Own Domain\nIf you are on your site editor\n1. Go to your site editor, and click \"SETTINGS > Domains\".2. Look for the \"REGISTER NEW DOMAIN\" box, type in your preferred domain name, and click \"Search Domain\".\nNote: If you have an existing domain connected to your site, it will be removed and then replaced with the new domain you're registering.\nIf you are on your dashboard\n1. Go to\u00a0your Strikingly Dashboard > \"Domains\" and click \"REGISTER NEW DOMAIN\".\n2. Type in your desired domain name and click \"SEARCH DOMAIN\".\u00a0A list of suggested domains displays, you will see these results:\nAvailable - You can purchase this domain for a specified price.\nFree for the first year - If you're already on a yearly plan, you can pick one of these domains to register for free or pay for the differences. To learn more, visit Strikingly Domain: Free Offer / Domain Credit.\nNot available - It's not possible to purchase these domains. You can check the suggestions list instead.\n3. Pick the year you want to have your domain for (default is 1 year).\n4. Click \"REGISTER\".\nStep 2: Fill in Your Personal Information\n1. Fill out all the fields. Every field is required.\u00a0Your personal information will be listed as the owner of the domain, but it's private, and won't be shown or shared with the public. WHOIS/Domain Privacy is included with all Strikingly Domains.\n2. Make sure to put in a working email. An email verification will be sent after the purchase to verify your domain ownership. If you have an Apple email (@me.com, @apple.com, @icloud.com), we'd encourage you to use a different email to ensure that you receive your verification email.\n3. All the information should be authentic, or the registration might fail.\n4. Click \"SUBMIT\".\n5. Review your personal information details.\n6. Keep \"Auto-renew my domain\" checked if you want your domain to be automatically charged and renewed for you 7 days before the expiration date.\n7. Click \"CONFIRM PAYMENT\" and you will be billed immediately. If you don't have billing information saved yet, you will be required to enter the details of your card or PayPal before you click the \"Confirm Payment\" button.\nNote: If you purchase the wrong name by accident, we can not refund the registration cost. However, you can remove the auto-renewal to avoid renewing next year. Then register a new or correct domain name.\nStep 3: Verify Your Domain Ownership via Email (very important)\nAfter you confirm the domain purchase, you'll receive an email with the title \"VERIFICATION REQUIRED - Please verify your domain name(s) as soon as possible\" within 24 hours from support@strikingly.com asking you to verify your email address. The email is sent to the address you entered during registration.\nIf you don't receive a verification email, then check your email's Spam/Junk folder. If you don't verify your email address, your domain might be suspended.\nEmail verification is a very important step in this process. You must verify your domain from this email within 15 days of registration or it will be suspended. Read more here: Strikingly Domain: Verify your Domain via email.\nStep 4: Connect Your Strikingly Domain to Your Strikingly Site\nIf you purchase your domain from the site editor, your Strikingly domain will be connected to your site automatically. If you purchase your domain from the dashboard, you'll need to manually connect your Strikingly domain to your site.\u00a0Note: You must be on a paid plan to use the \"custom domain connection\" feature.\n1. Go to your Strikingly site editor, and click \"SETTINGS > Domains\".\n2. Put your Strikingly domain in the \"Connect a Domain You Already Own\" box, such as \"www.yourdomain.com\" (without https:// or http:// or /).\n3. Click \"UPDATE\".\nNOTE:\nType your domain in lowercase to avoid the \"Page not found\" error when accessing your site.\nIf you purchased your domain from Strikingly, you're done!\nIf it's from a third-party registrar, click here and follow the next steps.\nStep 5: Wait for the Records to Take Effect\nOnce done connecting your domain, please allow a few up to 48 hours for the changes in the domain records to take effect globally. Once it's up,\u00a0HTTPS/SSL will be automatically activated\u00a0within 24 hours.\u00a0Be sure to\u00a0clear your browser cache\u00a0before you check to see if the domain is working.\nAfter you complete your own domain, you might also want to get a professional business email address, visit Strikingly Email: Creating Custom Email Addresses.\nFAQ\n1. How much does registering a new domain cost?\nThe cost of registering a new domain depends on the TLD (top-level domain, ie .com, .net) you choose. However, you'll be billed $24.95 per year for registering domains with the extensions .com, .net, .org, .co, and .me.\n2. Can you register my domain for me?\nDomain registration requires personal and sensitive information like credit card information. We like to keep your information private, so we won't be able to register your domain for you.\n3. How long should I wait before my site is up?\nNormally, it takes\u00a0a few up to 48 hours for the changes in the domain records to take effect globally. Once it's up, HTTPS/SSL will be automatically activated\u00a0within 24 hours.\u00a0Be sure to\u00a0clear your browser cache\u00a0before you check to see if the domain is working.\n4. Can I get more than one custom domain?\nYes! You can get as many as you want. When you register a domain through Strikingly, we'll automatically hook it up through the settings of the site you're buying it on -- if you're buying extra domains, make sure to check what page you're using.\nMaybe you'd like yourname.com, yourproject.com, and event2014.com! Or if you like to add subdomains, like shop.yourdomain.com, or info.yourdomain.com, you can visit Strikingly Domain: Creating Subdomains. Or Connecting Multiple Domains to One Strikingly Site.\n5. Can I manage my own domain settings or transfer my domain away from Strikingly?\nYes! If your domain's DNS manager isn't activated yet, contact us at support@strikingly.com. Once you log in to your domain dashboard, you'll be able to manage host records or transfer your domain. This way, you can add subdomains, manage redirects, and more. Here's more about Strikingly Domain: Viewing Domain Info and Managing DNS Records.\nIf you want to change your domain host (including billing and renewal), you can visit Strikingly Domain: Transferring Domains Away.\n6.\u00a0What TLDs are available?We support most domain extensions, you can choose from 500+ TLDs. However, there are some TLDs not available, like below:\n.aero.ar.pt.br.coop.hk.hu.law.abogado.lv.no.ro.se.nu.travel.us.sg.it.property\nIn case you need assistance, shoot us a line at support@strikingly.com or chat with us.\nWas this article helpful?\n35 out of 36 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

If you want to create a gallery section, your images will be limited to 20.\nCan I change the order of the sliders?\nYou can re-order the slides in the section by clicking the \"Slider\" button at the top right corner. You can click and drag the slides from the slider menu, then re-arrange them in the order that you'd like them displayed.\nCan you tell me the image size in the Slider Section (Fresh Template)?\nSections collapse and expand depending on the content. If you want your slider section to expand, here\u2019s a trick--click on any text box (with or without text) and add more spaces by hitting Enter (from your keyboard) a few times. The section will think you have more content so that it will expand!\nHow can I reposition the text in the slider section?\nTry different layouts for a slide by clicking the [LAYOUT] button at the slider section's top right corner.\nIf you want the text on the side but don\u2019t want the foreground image, click on the latter and choose \"Remove\".\nHow would the slider section look on my mobile?\nThe background image will be scaled to fit your mobile screen. Depending on your background setting, it may be stretched or centered.\nThe foreground image will appear on top of the text.\nThe call-to-action button will be at the bottom of the section.\nI want to change the color of the button on my slider. Can I do that from my end?\nYes! You can change the color of the button by clicking it and selecting \"Design\".\u00a0 Don't forget to click \"Save\" after customizing the color.\nIf you have more questions about the slider section, email us at support@strikingly.com\u00a0or chat with us.\nWas this article helpful?\n7 out of 11 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

Some domain registrars will do this if you try to activate URL forwarding to your Strikingly site. This also causes SEO and mobile issues.\n2) You have a free account with us and you connected your domain to your Strikingly site via URL forwarding/redirect with masking/iframe.\nURL forwarding or custom domain connection is only available for Limited, Pro, and VIP users. Once you purchase a plan (either Limited or Pro), that error will go away. Once you've done this, we also have a tutorial on how you can properly connect your domain to your Strikingly site! Let us know if you have any questions.\nYou cannot forward but you can use a simple URL redirect from your domain registrar, so visitors going to your domain will be redirected to the strikingly.com domain, but this means that your visitors will see the strikingly.com domain in their URL bar. This solution does not require you to purchase a paid plan. To do this:\n1. Log in to your domain registrar (where you purchased your domain).\u00a02. Add domain forwarding from domain.com to http://page.mystrikingly.com (no masking/framing).3. Add subdomain forwarding from www to http://page.mystrikingly.com (no masking/framing).\nIf you're having trouble, send us an email at support@strikingly.com\u00a0or chat with us.

This means that Facebook or LinkedIn won't immediately pick up your changes.So, what's the solution?\nUse the Facebook\u00a0Debugger\u00a0to clear Facebook's cache. This is how Facebook sees your link!\u00a0If you go to the debugger and drop in the URL you\u2019re having trouble with, Facebook will actually reach out to your URL right then and grab the current content to display the debugger results. Doing this also clears Facebook\u2019s cache of your page instantly. (sometimes you need to do it 2\u20133 times to get the latest updates.)\u00a0After you link your URL, you can immediately go back and type your update in again, and the good stuff will show up. It\u2019s that easy!\nStill not working and having a custom domain?\nIf you are working with a custom domain, and Facebook is not recognizing your content, it is most likely because you have connected your domain incorrectly. You probably forward yourdomain.com to strikingly.com/yoursite.\nTo fix it, follow our custom domain connection tutorial!\nClearing LinkedIn\u2019s Link Sharing Preview Cache\n1. Access the LinkedIn Post Inspector here. If the link doesn't work, copy this URL to your browser: https://www.linkedin.com/post-inspector/inspect/\n2. Input your site URL and click the \"Inspect\" button. The updated share image will be shown on the preview.\n3. Try sharing your URL again on LinkedIn to see if it is updated.\nIn case the post inspector doesn't work, you may clear the sharing preview cache by tricking LinkedIn into \"thinking\" that your page is a brand new page. You can do this by adding an invented variable to the link when you share your site on LinkedIn.\nExample:\nOriginal link: http://www.domain.com/\n\"New\" link: http://www.domain.com/?1\n\"?1\" was added at the end of the site's URL. It will force the metadata to be recollected. Don't worry, it won't affect your webpage.\nIn case you need assistance, shoot us a line at support@strikingly.com or chat with us.\nCreate your own awesome website with Strikingly today!\nWas this article helpful?\n13 out of 14 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

Will my domain and domain email stop working during the transfer?\nDuring the transfer process, your domain and domain email may be unavailable for a period of time. Please make sure this doesn't impact your business or any important tasks. Check with your email provider to ensure there won't be any restrictions or issues by transferring the domain to Strikingly.\n3. Can I transfer an expired domain to Strikingly?\nYou can still transfer an expired domain, so long as it's still in the grace period (usually within 40 days after expiration) and not in the redemption period.\n4. How do I cancel a pending domain transfer?\nIf your domain hasn't been approved by you, we can cancel the transfer process for you. Email us at support@strikingly.com\u00a0or chat with us.\n5. If I am going to transfer a domain to Strikingly, is there an additional fee?\nThere's no additional fee for the transfer itself. But you will need to pay to extend your domain for another year on Strikingly. Domain pricing is based on the extension/TLD (.com, .net, etc).\n6. Why can't I transfer my domain to Strikingly?\nIf you see a red error message, it means that Strikingly currently doesn't support your domain. You can contact us for further information, or you can connect your Domain to your Strikingly site instead.\n7. Which TLDs (top-level domains) are supported for transfer?\nWe support transferring most domain extensions. You can choose from 500+ TLDs.

Why did I get the error \u201cInvalid Auth/EPP Code\u201d when transferring my domain?\nThis means that the \"transfer \" code (Auth/EPP) you entered is either missing some characters or is not the correct code. To fix this, make sure you select all the code and copy it exactly as it is shown, or type in all the characters manually. If you keep seeing an error message, it's best to contact your current domain registrar and ask them for a new code. They can provide you with the correct code to use for your domain.\nIn case you need assistance, shoot us a line at\u00a0support@strikingly.com or\u00a0chat with us.\nWas this article helpful?\n6 out of 7 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

The verification process can sometimes be tricky and you might encounter a few errors. We've listed down some of the errors, the possible causes, and how to resolve them.\nError #1: \u201cCould not find your site. Please check that you provided the correct URL for your property.\u201d\nError #2: \u201cWe couldn\u2019t find your verification meta tag.\u201d\nError #3: \u201cYour meta tag is incorrect. Are you using a meta tag for a different site or user account? Found meta tag:\u201d\nError #4: \u201cThe connection to your server timed out\u201d\nError #5: \u201cWe could not find your verification token in your domain\u2019s TXT records.\u201d\nError #6:\u00a0 Sitemap \u201cCouldn\u2019t Fetch\u201d Error\nError #1: \u201cCould not find your site. Please check that you provided the correct URL for your property.\u201d\nPossible Cause 1: The site is hidden from search engines.\nResolution: Disable the option from the site editor's Settings:\nGo to Site Editor > Settings > Show Advanced > Privacy & Legal.\nUncheck the \"Hide from Search Engines\".\nClick \"Save\".\nPublish the site.\nPossible Cause 2: The site is password-protected.\nResolution: Disable the option from the site editor's Settings:\nGo to Site Editor > Settings > Show Advanced > Privacy & Legal.\nEmpty the box under \"Password Protection\".\nClick \"Save\".\nPublish the site.\nPossible Cause 3: The site URL used to submit property is different from the actual site URL. Examples:\nSubmitted URL\nActual Site URL\nold.mystrikingly.com\nnew.mystrikingly.com\nsite.mystrikingly.com\nwww.newsiteurl.com\nhttp://www.siteurl.com\nhttps://www.siteurl.com\nResolution: Before verifying the site, make sure that the submitted site URL is correct and the most current. You can check for the domain being used by the site by going to Site Editor > Settings> Domains.\nError #2: \u201cWe couldn\u2019t find your verification meta tag.\u201d\nPossible Causes:\na. Verification method is not supported.b. The HTML tag has not been added yet.c. HTML tag was added but:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 - Site was not published after saving the tag.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 - Site was published and you clicked \u201cVerify\u201d immediately (did not wait for 5-15 minutes).Resolution: Make sure that before the verification is correct and added correctly added within the site editor. Also, make sure to give it enough time for the updates to take effect.\nError #3: \u201cYour meta tag is incorrect. Are you using a meta tag for a different site or user account? Found meta tag:\u201d\nPossible Causes:\na. Site was cloned but the verification tag was not changed.b. Site was transferred from one user to another. The new owner tried to verify the site without removing the old tag.c. Old verification meta tag was removed and a new one was added, but the live site was not updated yet (after publishing).Resolution: This error is usually caused by not updating the meta tag. Always make sure the tags are updated when cloning and make sure to publish the site when changes are made.\nError #4: \u201cThe connection to your server timed out\u201d\nPossible Causes:\n1. This could occur if our servers are down or our platform is responding slowly.2. Sometimes the cause could be unknown.Resolution:\u00a0In this case, it's best to wait 3-5 minutes and try to verify the site again.\nError #5: \u201cWe could not find your verification token in your domain\u2019s TXT records.\u201d\nPossible Cause: The TXT records have just been added, and Google Search Console cannot detect them yet on the domain\u2019s DNS.Resolution: Wait for the propagation of the TXT records, then try again. Domain DNS records usually update globally within 24\u201348 hours. You may have to wait it out a bit before retrying the verification.\nError #6:\u00a0 Sitemap \u201cCouldn\u2019t Fetch\u201d Error\nFirst, make sure your sitemap URL is accurate and accessible. If the error persists, click \"Couldn't fetch\" for more details on the issue.\nPossible Cause 1: Sitemap could not be read\nResolution for \"Sitemap could not be read\": This is usually your site prevents search engines to fetch. You can disable the \"Hide from Search Engines\" option.\nPossible Cause 2: Robots.txt unreachable\nResolution for \"Robots.txt unreachable\":\n- Sometimes, this issue can be temporary. Wait for 10 minutes to 24 hours, then try fetching the sitemap again.\n- If you're using a free Strikingly URL, other sites on mystrikingly.com might affect yours. For instance, if a site on mystrikingly.com violates Google's policies, it might affect the shared domain, including your site. To avoid any such potential issues, it's a good idea to Connecting a Domain to Your Strikingly Site. This will help avoid potential issues with shared domains.\nIf you missed a few steps or want to proceed with setting up your Google Search Console, you can check out this article.

Strikingly offers two methods to link your domain with your site: connecting and transferring. This article aims to clarify the difference between these two methods and help you decide which option best suits your needs.\nTransferring a Domain to Strikingly\nTransferring a domain lets you manage both your domain and website through Strikingly. Strikingly becomes your domain host when you transfer your domain to Strikingly. It means:\nYou can manage your domain DNS from your Strikingly account.\nYou can renew your domain from your Strikingly account.\nYour domain will be automatically configured once it's connected.\nNote: Your account must be upgraded to a Premium Plan before you can connect a domain to your site.\nConnecting a Domain to Strikingly\nYour Strikingly site goes live when you enter your domain name into a web browser once you've connected your domain to Strikingly.\nIf you cannot transfer your domain, you can connect the domain instead. Your current domain host continues hosting your domain. You need to add two DNS records to point your domain to Strikingly.\nIf you want to transfer your domain to Strikingly, visit Strikingly Domain: Transferring Domains To Strikingly. If you have issues transferring, you can connect your Domain to your Strikingly site.\nIf you need assistance, shoot us a line at support@strikingly.com or chat with us.\nWas this article helpful?\n6 out of 7 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

But sometimes it's still good to have an idea about which image dimensions to upload.\nHere are some general guidelines!\nFirst, take note of roughly how wide the image appears on the page.\nBackground images:\u00a01600x900px. Read this article for more guidelines.\nFull-width images:\u00a0At least 1400px wide for the highest quality. (Height doesn't matter.)\nHalf-width images: At least 700px wide for the highest quality.\u00a0(Height doesn't matter.)\n1/3 width images: At least 480px wide for the highest quality. (Height doesn't matter.)\n1/4 width images: At least 360px wide for the highest quality. (Height doesn't matter.)\nSmall icons/logos: At least 100px wide.\nGallery images: Any size is fine! Gallery images will open in a lightbox overlaid on top of your site.\nREMEMBER: These pixel dimensions ARE NOT EXACT.\u00a0This is because Strikingly optimizes for a wide range of screen sizes, from large TVs to tiny phones, so there is not one single pixel width for any image. These guidelines only ensure quality for a large range of image sizes.\nWhat if my images are too small?\nGenerally, if your images are a bit smaller than recommended, it's not a problem at all -- they will just have\u00a0some extra space on the sides. But if your images are\u00a0much smaller than recommended, there will be a lot of extra space, and that extra space could look bad. You can consider changing layouts, or using a different section instead!\nWhat if my images are too large?\nIf the dimensions are too large, but the file size is below 15 MB, that's not a problem! We'll automatically scale down images, so they load fast, and your visitors are not downloading unnecessarily large images.\nGot any more questions?

You can group products into different categories and display store categories in the Simple Store section navigation.\nAdding Categories to Simple Store\nTo add and manage product categories (up to 50), go to the Store, then click \"Product Categories\". You can add, rename, delete, or reorder categories in this panel.\nAdding Subcategories to Simple Store:\nTo add subcategories to your categories, open the site editor and follow these steps:\nGo to \"Store\" > \"Product Categories\".\nClick the 3 horizontal dots next to the category you want.\nChoose \"Add Subcategory\"\nEnter the subcategory name and press \"Enter\".\nAdding Products to Categories\nAfter you\u2019ve set up the categories and subcategories, go back to your product manager to group your products into the categories.\nSelect a product to edit, and under \"Product Categories\", select the category/subcategory tag from the drop-down menu. You can add up to five category/subcategory tags for each product.\nLastly, click \"Save\" to save your changes and select a different product to continue adding categories.\nDisplaying Store Categorizations\nThere are two store categorization display options - you can either show all your product categories in one Simple Store section like this:\nOr you can choose to display one specific category for each Simple Store section like this:\nTo select which category you want to display in a Simple Store section, click on the dropdown list at the top right of your Simple Store section.\nIf you choose to display all product categories, a category navigation menu will appear at the top of the section.\nIf you choose to display one specific category for the store section, only products tagged with this category will be shown in the store section. This way, you can add multiple Simple Store sections\u00a0to your sites.\nIf you have any questions or feedback for us about our Simple Store categories feature, please ping us at support@strikingly.com\u00a0or chat with us!\nWas this article helpful?\n1 out of 1 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

Google indexes websites once every 2-5 days or even longer. When Google re-indexes your site, it will be fixed! Thanks for your patience.\nYou may want to hide your domain from Google immediately after you create a new page to prevent it from getting the wrong information first. Do this by going to Settings > Advanced > Privacy & Legal, then tick the \"Hide from search engines\" box.\nFirst, make sure that you hit the \"Publish\" button on your site -- this allows your site to be found on the internet. After publishing, there is still the usual 4 days to 4 weeks (it can take up to 6 months -- it depends on how fast Google indexes your site) period in which Google finds your site and records it.\nIf you have your custom domain connected, I also recommend you submit a sitemap to Google for more granular control over SEO. You'll be able to ask Google to take a look at your page much sooner. Take a look at this tutorial.\nYou can request that Google removes your previous site with webmaster's tools as well:https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/removals?pli=1In case you need assistance, shoot us a line at support@strikingly.com\u00a0or chat\u00a0with us.\nWas this article helpful?\n4 out of 4 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

However, the emails are not stored on any server. For instance, if you open your email client on your phone, your new emails are downloaded on your phone and are not stored on the server. When you access your email from your computer, it will not download the emails previously downloaded on your phone.\nWhat is SMTP?\nSimple Message Transfer Protocol (SMTP) allows your email client to send your email messages to your email server. It's also the protocol responsible for sending your message to the mailbox of your recipient email server.\nWhy should I use IMAP and not POP3?\nBased on the definition above, we recommend using IMAP because it allows you to sync your email messages across all devices where you have your email configured. Since POP3 doesn't store emails on the server, there are cases when you think you've lost your email when in fact, it was downloaded on another device earlier.\nHow do I set up IMAP and SMTP?\nMake sure that you can log in to your MyStrikingly Email account first before you set up your email client.

If you have multiple attachments, they can't add up to more than 27 MB. If you want to share large files, we recommend that you store them in the Files section (any type of file) or any cloud service, and share the file rather than attaching it to an email.\nHow much email/file storage do I have?\nYour email account has a capacity of 5 GB of storage for archiving your messages/files.\nTo buy more storage, you can contact us to add it for you. The charge for extra storage is US$25/5 GB per year.\nDo you offer a temporary email storage increase?\nNO. We currently do not offer a temporary increase in email storage. If your current storage is full, you can purchase an additional 5 GB for $25 per year.\nCan I increase my attachment or storage limit?\nThe attachment limit can't be increased. It's also worth noting that some mail servers do not accept large file attachments. Sending a file that exceeds the limit may result in your intended recipient being unable to receive it.\nIn case you need assistance, shoot us a line at\u00a0support@strikingly.com\u00a0or\u00a0chat with us.\nWas this article helpful?\n6 out of 7 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

When you use a domain registrar to forward from domain.com to http://page.mystrikingly.com (or strikingly.com/page) and checked the \"masked\" button, your domain will appear in the address bar; however, you have connected your domain incorrectly. This masking (or iframe) will result in many mobile and SEO issues\u2014read more!To fix this, connect your domain correctly. Here is our tutorial!\nFOR ALL USERSAnother common reason for a site seeming incompatible on mobile is because of background images\u2014are your images being cropped or chopped up?

The Payment Method Name\u00a0will be shown to the customer at checkout when they select a payment method. The Payment Instruction to Your Customers will be shown right before the customer confirms their order. (Refer to the animated GIF below to see how your customers will complete their order.)\nNote:\nYou must set up the actual offline payment process yourself!\nIf you only want to accept offline payments in certain countries, you can enter that information in the Payment Method Name - e.g.\u00a0\"Cash on Delivery - Only for Japan\"\nPayment instructions to your customers should include how payment will be collected, or anything else your customers should know when they order\u00a0with Offline Payments. This instruction will also be included in the \"order confirmed\" email notification sent to the customer.\nAfter setting up\u00a0Offline Payments, your customer can easily place their order without paying online.\nIf you want to deactivate offline payment, just click the \"Disable\" link on the bottom right of the offline payment settings panel.\nCompleting and Canceling Orders\nAs the store owner, you need to confirm payment was collected before marking orders Completed in your Simple Store Manager.\nIf you don\u2019t receive payment from your customer for a long time, you can cancel the order in the order manager. An email notification about order cancellation will be sent to your customer.\nPlease note that Offline Payments doesn't support digital download products.\nWe hope you find this feature useful!

Please allow up to a few hours of delay for our system to process the raw stats data and reflect the update on the stats diagram.\nThe data shown on Google Analytics might be different from Strikingly's Built-in Analytics. This is because:\nThe definition of \"unique views\" on Google Analytics is different from our system. Google Analytics drops cookies on a visitor's browser and uses cookies to decide whether the visitor has visited your site before, while we use IP to determine that. There are pros and cons to both ways, and we choose to use the IP way.\nFor geographic distributions of views/visits, it's possible that our system and Google Analytics use different geo-IP databases and have a slight difference.\nThe time zone used when querying stats data can be different. Our system uses UTC to do the query. However, the analytics displayed are based on your browser.\nSome Google Analytics views apply sampling to the stats data if your site has numerous page views, so it can be slightly different from Strikingly stats.\nTo Use Your Strikingly Built-in Analytics:\nFind Your Analytics Dashboard\nReading Your Analytics\nAnalytics Overview\nVisitors Analytics\nStore Analytics\nBlog Analytics\nContacts, Signups, Subscriptions Analytics\nFile Downloads Analytics\nFind Your Analytics Dashboard\nFrom your Strikingly Dashboard, click the \"x VIEWS LAST 7 DAYS\" button next to your site.\nIf you have more than 10 sites, you can click \"View Stats\" to see more stats. This is because we want to make sure your dashboard loads faster, so we only load stats from the last 7 days for 10 sites at most.\nYou can also go to your site editor > \"SETTINGS\" > \"ANALYTICS\" to view your site's statistics.\nReading Your Analytics\nAnalytics Overview\nUnique Visitors - Past 24 Hours/Week/Month/3 Months - the total count of unique views during the period you choose. You can click the tab on top to choose the period.\nTop Country - Where the most visitors came from\nNote: Our system considers all visits from the same IP during a certain time period as 1 unique view during that period.\nFor example, if your site had 3 visits from the same IP yesterday and 4 visits from the same IP today, you would have 1 unique view for yesterday, 1 unique view for today, and 1 unique view (not 2) for the past week from that IP.\nVisitors Analytics\nTop Pages - the most popular pages.\nCountries - where visitors are browsing from.\nDevices - which device are the visitors using: desktop or mobile.\nTraffic Sources - where visitors are coming from before landing on your site (direct, search engines, etc.).\nDirect Traffic - visiting your site by manually typing in a URL, rather than coming to your site from another page.\nwww.yourdomain.com - visiting your site by clicking on your site logo or the \u201cBack to the Site\u201d button on your blog posts and redirected to your site.\nStore Analytics\nStore Analytics provides valuable insights into your sales performance. Here are some key metrics you can review on your sales report:\nRevenue - total sales revenue value of all orders at the chosen time and at all times.\nOrder Received - total count of all received orders at the chosen time and at all times.\nSales Funnel - which sales funnel drove the most revenue.\nBlog Analytics\nTop Viewed Blog Posts - the most popular blog posts.\nContacts, Signups, Subscriptions Analytics\nContact Form Responses - total count of all received responses at the chosen time and at all times.\nFile Downloads Analytics\nFile Downloads - total count of downloads in the chosen time.\nYou can also find the total count of downloads for each file in the editor.\n1. Go to the editor, and open the file uploading window (Visit here to check how to open the file uploading window).\n2. Click the \"UPLOADED FILES\" tab.\n3. There's a \"Downloads\" column that shows the count of downloads.\nFeel free to email us\u00a0or\u00a0chat with us\u00a0if you have more questions!\nWas this article helpful?\n9 out of 13 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

Once it's done, HTTPS/SSL will be automatically activated within 24 hours.\nDuring this time, you might see an error when you use HTTPS:// to visit your website. For example:\nYour connection is not private - Google Chrome\nYour connection is not secure - Mozilla Firefox\nThere is a problem connecting securely to this website - Microsoft Edge.\nIf you still encounter the \"not secure or not private\" error after setting up your domain's records for more than 24 hours, you can try the following troubleshooting steps to resolve the issue.\n1. Check if your domain is configured correctly.\nThe record type you selected is \"CNAME\".\nYou changed the example records to your own domain name. For example:\nYour domain is www.example.com, the value should be: www.example.com.s.strikinglydns.com\nYour domain is www.abc.net, the value should be: www.abc.net.s.strikinglydns.com\nYour domain is www.yourdomain.com, the value should be: www.yourdomain.com.s.strikinglydns.com\n2. Check if you are using A record for your root domain.\nIf you use forwarding for your root domain domain.com, then it will not have HTTPS/SSL. You can set up an A record instead.\n1) Delete your current forwarding.\n2) Add an A record pointing to 54.183.102.22.\nNote:\nIf you have other A Records in your account:\nHost: @ - delete it if it's not pointing to 54.183.102.22.\nHost: blank - delete.\nHost: Mail or Email - do not delete.

If you want to connect your domain to another platform, you can edit your DNS records or ask us to do it for you.\nBefore You Transfer\nYou need to wait for\u00a01 to 2 weeks\u00a0for the domain transfer to complete from the time you entered the authorization/EPP code at your new provider.\nYou need to\u00a0monitor and reply to confirmation emails\u00a0to complete the transfer process.\nDuring the transfer,\u00a0all the DNS records will stop working. Your domain may go offline during the transfer period. Or if you have domain emails, your email may not work. Check with your email provider to ensure there won't be any restrictions or issues by transferring the domain away from Strikingly.\nYour domain has been registered for\u00a0more than 60 days, as per the ICANN Transfer Policy.\nIf you recently changed your domain contact info ie email, name, etc. the domain will be locked for 60 days before it can be transferred, per ICANN Change of Registrant Policy.\nMake sure to start the transfer before your domain's expiration date. If your domain has already expired, you need to renew it first.\nYour domain contact\u00a0email address is correct, and you have access\u00a0to it.\nIf you are ready to proceed, follow these steps:\nStep 1: Request to Release Your Domain\nStep 2: Check Your Email for Authorization/EPP Code\nStep 3: Monitor and Respond to Confirmation Emails\nStep 4: Wait for the Transfer to Complete\nStep 1: Request to Release Your Domain\n1. Go to Strikingly Dashboard\u00a0>\u00a0Domains\u00a0>\u00a0SETTINGS and check if the domain is registered for more than 60 days.\n2. Send us a request at support@strikingly.com\u00a0or chat with us to release your domain.3. After we release your domain, we will:\nDisable your domain's WHOIS/Domain privacy.\nUnlock your domain for transfer.\nSend the authorization/EPP code to the email that you registered when you purchased the domain from Strikingly.\nStep 2: Check Your Email for Authorization/EPP Code\n1. Go to the email that you registered when you purchased the domain from Strikingly.\n2. Get the authorization/EPP code to the receiving registrar (where you'll transfer the domain) so they can start processing the transfer.\nStep 3: Monitor and Respond to Confirmation Emails\nFor the domain transfer to continue, you must confirm the transfer approval email sent to you within the transfer period. Failure to do so during the five-day transfer period may prevent the process from completing. Please check your email's spam/junk folder, in case you haven't received the approval email in your inbox.\nStep 4: Wait for the Transfer to Complete\nDuring the domain transfer, your site may go offline. A domain's nameservers/DNS settings cannot be changed during a Registrar transfer. Once your domain is available on the new registrar\u2019s side, you can check if your site is up and if not, you need to set it up again on your new registrar\u2019s side.

Note that this feature is for users and businesses in the US and EU that have a sales tax ID or VAT. Taxes can be extremely complicated, so be sure to consult a tax professional for questions about applicable tax laws.\nGetting Started\nTo set up sales tax, go to your Simple Store Dashboard and click the \"TAXES\" tab. Select the applicable Tax Mode from the dropdown.\nOnce you\u2019ve decided on a tax rate with your tax advisor, enter the tax rate in the field. You can choose to add different rates for all states or varied tax rates based on location.\nThis will apply the flat tax rate to all orders (excluding shipping). Your tax rate applies to:\nThe subtotal before shipping costs are added (if applicable)\nThe subtotal after discounts (if applicable)\nEvery item in your shop\nEvery location you ship to\nCheckout\nTaxes will appear in your buyer\u2019s checkout process like this:\nNote:\nIf you enable tax in your store, the tax is calculated by using this formula:\nTax = Price * Tax rate\nIf the buyer has a coupon, tax should be applied to the discounted subtotal.\nReporting\nWe don\u2019t have an accounting feature for calculating the amount of taxes you\u2019ve collected through your shop, but you\u2019ll be able to export the data through the order management dashboard in a .CSV file by going to your Orders page:\nIn case you need assistance, shoot us a line at support@strikingly.com or chat with us.\nWas this article helpful?\n2 out of 5 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

You can offer your customers various types of discounts through our Simple Store Coupon feature. Promotions can be a great way to drive revenue! You can create:\nPercentage-based discounts\nFlat discounts\nFree shipping discounts\nTake a look at how you can add and manage coupon codes below:\nHow to Create a Coupon Code\n1. Go into your Simple Store manager, click \"Promotions\" and choose \"Coupons\". Then, click the \u201cCREATE COUPON\u201d button.\n2. In the coupon editor, enter a \"code\" for your coupon to apply the discount at checkout. Our suggestion is to keep it short (easy to remember) but not too easy to guess.\n3. Next, set the expiration date for your offer. Note that the coupon will expire at 11:59 PM in your time zone.\n4. Now, you can set the type of discount you\u2019d like to offer. There are 3 types of discounts you can offer your customer in the Simple Store:\na. Percentage-based discount\nA percentage-based discount is a specific percentage applied to a price. You can set a percentage-based discount for:\nAll orders (excluding shipping)\nOrders over fixed amount (excluding shipping)\nSpecific products\nb. Flat discount\nA flat discount is a set monetary amount of a price. You can set a flat discount for:\nAny orders (excluding shipping)\nOrders over fixed amount (excluding shipping)\nc. Free shipping discount\nA free shipping discount overrides the shipping costs of an order. You can set free shipping discounts for any order or orders over a fixed price.\n5. For \"For all orders\" & \"For orders over\", you can enter the maximum number of uses for the discount. This limit applies to the overall usage of the discount, and not to the maximum number of times an individual customer can apply it.\nFor \"Specific products\" & \"Specific categories\", you can also enter the \"Product Quantity Limit Per Order\" for the discount. This is to limit the number of items this discount can apply to in a single order. If this coupon applies to multiple items with different prices, the highest-price items will be discounted first.\nNote: Currently, it is not possible to set a coupon for single use only.\n6. After you fill out all information for a coupon, click on the \u201cSave\u201d button at the bottom right to launch your coupon!\nCoupon Management\nOnce you\u2019ve set up your coupon codes, you can manage them in your \"Coupon Dashboard\". You\u2019ll be able to delete the coupon or reactivate your coupon after it expires by setting a new expiration date.\nHowever, you won\u2019t be able to change the coupon code or coupon offer once a coupon has been created. Once orders start coming in, you\u2019ll be able to view how many times a coupon has been used in your coupon dashboard. You can add up to 100 coupons for your Simple Store.\nCoupons in the Checkout Process\nYour customers will see the discount applied immediately after entering the coupon code during the checkout process. The percentage-based and flat discounts will be applied pre-shipping to your customer's entire order. The free shipping discount will be shown after your customers enter their shipping addresses. Buyers will not be able to stack discounts, only one discount can be redeemed per order.\nThe free shipping discount will be shown after your customers enter a shipping address.\nSetting the Product Quantity Limit Per Order\nYou can set a limit to the number of items to which a discount code can be applied. This is available on a percentage-based discount for specific products.\nHere's an example: You're selling shirts at $10 each and you'd want the coupon code set to 15% and limited to three shirts per purchase.\nBuyer 1 buys 10 shirts. The total will be computed as (3 shirts x $10 x 15%) + (7 shirts x $10).\nBuyer 2 buys 3 shirts and applies the discount. The total will be computed as (3 shirts x $10 x 15%).\nIf you set the \"Product Quantity Limit Per Order\" to \"Unlimited\", then regardless of how many are purchased, the discount applies to all of the purchases.\nHowever, if you have different variations per product, purchases will be discounted per product and not per variation. Say, you have red shirts, blue shirts, and green shirts. Setting the Product Quantity Limit Per Order to Unlimited with a 50% discount.\nBuyer 1 gets 10 red shirts, and 5 green shirts and uses the discount, that\u2019s (15 shirts x $10 x 50%).\nPromoting discounts\nYou can distribute your coupon codes to your customers through email, or share your coupon code on social media. You can also promote your offer on your site to allow all visitors to use it.\nIf you need assistance, shoot us a line at support@strikingly.com\u00a0or\u00a0chat with us.\nWas this article helpful?\n6 out of 6 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

Here's our quick tutorial:\nCan I add a background to a video section?\nNot all sections of your page can include a background image or video - this is to keep sections clean, balanced, and easy to read.\nWill the videos play on mobile devices?\nVideo backgrounds will not play on mobile (phones and tablets) because different OS developers intentionally disabled autoplay on mobile devices to protect users\u2019 bandwidth.       Instead, the video's thumbnail (the one shown on YouTube and Vimeo previews) will be shown in the background.

You can also set up flat shipping rates for different regions. Learn how you can add and manage shipping options in our short guide below:\nAbout Flat Rate Shipping\nWe currently offer one shipping option in Simple Store - Flat Rate Shipping. Flat Rate Shipping is a standard rate charged regardless of a package\u2019s weight or size. You charge one standard shipping fee per order or per item. It\u2019s ideal for most businesses that want a simple shipping setup that\u2019s easy to understand for your customers.\nGetting Started\nTo get started, get into your Simple Store manager and select the SHIPPING tab. All sellers have the option to set a base shipping fee per order and an additional item fee for each additional item purchased.\nFor example, if the shipping fee for the order (or first item) is $5 and the shipping fee per additional item is $2, the shipping cost for a customer ordering 4 items is $11 ($5 + $2 + $2 + $2).\nShipping Options\nYou can also set different flat shipping rates for different regions. First, add a country or region you\u2019re shipping to by clicking \u201cADD REGION\u201d button.\nFor each country or region you\u2019ve added, enter the fee for the first item and for each additional item (optional). You can add up to 20 regions to ship to.\nNote: Setting up regions will restrict shipping to only the regions or countries you\u2019ve added.\nExample #1:\nYou want to set a domestic shipping fee as well as a fee for orders to the rest of the world, add the rates for the US, and select \u201cRest of the World\u201d as your additional region.\nYou can also set up different shipping rates for overlapping regions. For example, if you\u2019re a seller in France, you can set a domestic shipping rate, a rate for orders sent to Spain, and then set a rate for Europe.\nCustomers from France, Spain, or from the rest of Europe will only see the shipping rate that applies to the shipping address they\u2019ve entered.\nAfter setting up your shipping options, you need to add a\u00a0 \"Shipping Option Name\" and click on [SAVE] button on the bottom to save your changes.\nShipping in Checkout Flow\nIn the checkout flow, your customers will only see the countries you set in the shipping settings.\nShipping calculations will appear after your customers fill out the shipping address.\nNote: You can also set up a shipping fee per item weight.\nWe hope that you'll find this feature useful!

This is to prevent domain hi-jacking/domain theft--the change in domain registration without the permission of the original owner of the domain. Here's more about the new ICANN policy.\nFAQ\n1. Why isn't my domain working? It used to work.\n2.\u00a0I received an email with the subject \"VERIFICATION REQUIRED - Please verify your domain name(s) as soon as possible\". What is this email for?\n3. I got a verification email, but I deleted it. Will I still get another email?\n4. Why I didn't receive the domain verification email?\n5. My domain is suspended, showing unverified, What should I do now?\n1. Why isn't my domain working? It used to work.\nIf you have recently purchased a domain and did not respond to the Domain verification email (see below), chances are, your domain has been suspended for being unverified.\n2.\u00a0I received an email with the subject \"VERIFICATION REQUIRED - Please verify your domain name(s) as soon as possible\". What is this email for?\nThe verification email is sent to you when you register a domain name with Strikingly. This email contains a link that takes you to a page that displays the first and last name and the email address you used when you registered the domain. You need to click on the link to confirm. Confirming will prevent your site from going down after 15 days.\nNote: Domain registrant verification only applies to gTLDs (generic top-level domains) such as .com, .net, .org, and does not apply to ccTLDs (country code top-level domains) like .co and .me.\n3. I got a verification email, but I deleted it. Will I still get another email?\nStrikingly\u00a0sends out emails to you within the 15-day period. If you haven't verified or didn't receive it, you may contact us through support@strikingly.com and we'll resend the verification email.\nAlternatively, you may let us know which alternate email you'd like to use to receive the verification email and we'll resend the email from our end!\nHere's a timeline of when verification emails are sent:\nImage Credits: OpenSRS\n4. Why didn't I receive the domain verification email?\nTry to check your spam or bulk folders!\nNothing in spam? If you use @mac.com/@icloud.com or @me.com addresses, we encourage you to Whitelist / Add a Safe Sender of @registrarmail.net, with the IP address of 64.99.180.0/24. You can do this within the Apple Email/iCloud Interface. This issue is originating at Apple's server, and we wouldn't be able to fix this issue on our end.\nAs an alternative (if you're using an Apple address), we can change your email to a different address (Gmail, Hotmail, etc.). Once we change your email address, it will toggle the system to automatically send another verification email to your new email.\u00a0 Contact us through email\u00a0or through\u00a0chat!\n5. My domain is suspended, showing unverified, what should I do now?\nYour domain would be restored once you've gone through the domain verification by clicking the link in the verification email, and after you confirm your email address.\nTo resend the verification email to your inbox, contact us via email at support@strikingly.com or through\u00a0chat!\nWas this article helpful?\n18 out of 19 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

Watch the video or read the instructions below to know how to change or add background images:\nAdding Background Images:\nTo add a background image, follow these steps:\n1. Open your site editor.\n2. Click the Background button on the top right corner of the section.\n3. Choose \"Image\".\n4. You can either click \"More\" to view our image library, or click \"Upload image\" and choose an image from your device. Please note that we can only accept\u00a0gif, jpeg, png, bmp, and ico.\n5. Click \"Save\".\nCan I add a background to a section that doesn't have one?\nNot all sections of your page can include a background image -- this is mainly to keep your content clean and easy to read. In this case, background image sections are generally reserved for simple content like a big tagline. More about backgrounds.\n(It's possible to use CSS to add a background as a workaround, but the ability to edit CSS is only available for Pro users and above. Email support@strikingly.com for more info).\nHow can I make my text more visible?\nTo make your text more visible, you can choose to have a dark overlay on your images, or use black/white text. We offer this option by default. Check out our overlay selections!\nTo remove the default overlay, click on the background button. You will see three overlay options. Choose the option on the left for white text without any image overlay, or the option on the right for black text. The option in the middle is the one with the dark overlay.\nCan I set different background images for desktop and mobile versions?\nWe currently don't support customizing the background image separately for desktop and mobile versions. The background settings apply uniformly to both desktop and mobile views.\nNote:\nWe recommend using images with 1600 x 900 px for a more optimized view.\nYou can chat with us or email us at support@strikingly.com\nWas this article helpful?\n8 out of 10 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

But this also means it usually takes 5 - 15 minutes for new content to propagate to all servers, depending on various factors such as server status, network congestion, etc.\nTo verify that your changes are properly published, you can modify your URL so that it will bypass the CDN temporarily. Here is how you can do it.\nSuppose you have just published your site and your site URL is http://mysite.mystrikingly.com, but you find that your latest change is not refreshed, you can add a ?v=new to the end of your URL:\nhttp://mysite.strikingly.com/?v=new\nThis will bypass the CDN and you should now be able to see your latest change.\nSimilarly, if your site has a custom domain http://www.mysite.com, you can visit: http://www.mysite.com/?v=new\nOnce you have verified that your site is updated, it's just a matter of time for the content to propagate to all CDN servers.\nThat's it! Now go and make some awesome websites with Strikingly!\nIn case you need assistance, shoot us a line at support@strikingly.com\u00a0or chat\u00a0with us.\nWas this article helpful?\n10 out of 15 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

We recommend a size of 1600 pixels wide by 900 pixels tall, so\u00a0your background can look great on all devices. Be careful about including non-background images of people, logos, and other content! Check how these look with our \"preview\" function.\nWhat background setting should I use?\nThere are a few options to size/align your background:\nStretch\u00a0is the default. This setting will stretch your image, so it covers the entire screen in both height and width. This is usually the best option because the image will act as a background on any screen size. However, if you have content on the sides of your image (particularly the left and right), it may not show on mobile phones.\nContain will ensure\u00a0that the entire image is visible without being cropped, but it may result in some blank space around the image on certain devices.\nCenter\u00a0means the image will be displayed in the middle of the section and will not be resized. However, if the image is too small, the background will show white space on the edges. If the image is too big, some parts may be cut off, especially on smaller screens.\nTile will center the image and then repeat it, which is useful for patterns.\nWhere can I get good background images?\nVarious search engines are a great place to find background images that suit you. Search for \u00a0\"_______ desktop backgrounds\" and see what you find. Remember to check image rights and do not use stock images you do not have the right to!\nInspiring visuals to use: https://www.vecteezy.com/Beautiful copyright-free images: http://gratisography.com/\nYou can use Strikingly's Icon/Background Library to find great images for your site. Go to \"Upload\" on any image and look at the tabs up top!\nCan I use image effects on my background images?\nUse effects in the photo editor to completely change the look of your images. Click on the image after you've uploaded it, and then choose \"Image Editor\".\nTry the \"filters\" and mirroring the image to see what complements your site. See what else you can do!\nNote: For image sizing specifications, please check out our guidelines here.\nIn case you need assistance, shoot us a line at support@strikingly.com or chat with us.\nWas this article helpful?\n16 out of 17 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

Can I do more major maintenance?\nYes! You can edit your site at any time after publishing, and it'll be done the same way as you were editing it before publishing. All of your changes can be made live so that your viewers can be kept up to date.\n(Hit \"PUBLISH\" after you preview your site. There is a delay for custom domains, but hitting publish will show your changes immediately -- this is because we use a CDN to make sure your site is fast in any country and always online!)\nWhat about major changes?\nMaybe you don't want to have your users see all the changes you are making. Here are a couple of things you can do:\nKeep saving, but don't publish until you're ready (All Users)\nThe live version is different from the editor/saved/preview version. Thus, you can simply keep editing and saving (and logging out), until you are ready to publish! Click here to read more about Publish!\nClone the site (All users)\nIf you go to strikingly.com and log in, you'll be at the dashboard. Here, you can use the \"clone\" button -- it looks like two sheets of paper -- to make a copy of your website. Then, you can edit one while leaving the other untouched.\nIf you have a domain and you're ready to switch to the new version of your site...\nGo to your 1st version and delete the domain in \"custom domain\" settings.\nGo to the 2nd version, and add your domain.\nHit Publish to push the changes.\nYou don't need to make any changes on the domain registrar side!\nPassword protection (Pro users)\nYou can also add a password to your page so that it looks like this for all viewers:\u00a0http://www.strikingly.com/password\nGo to \"Settings > Show Advanced > Privacy\" to set this up!\nLet us know if you have any questions at support@strikingly.com or chat with us.\nWas this article helpful?\n15 out of 17 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

The meta description (meta tags) is the snippet that summarizes the site's content on the search engine results page - and adding it to your site is very important for improving your site's search engine ranking.\nBefore You Begin\nMeta Description is not visible on the page itself, they appear in the code and instruct search engines to display in search results.\nAdding a meta description does not guarantee automatic updates or add information in search results. It is determined by search engines. To speed up this process you can Verifying Google Search Console and Submitting Sitemap or request a re-index using Google Search Console.\nSearch engines cut off descriptions around 160 characters.\nTips for Good Meta Descriptions\nA good meta description is short, to-the-point, and tells the searcher what they'll get when they land on your site, and an accurate meta description can help improve your clickthrough. For example:\nJohnny's Bakery is a gourmet bakery and confectionery based in the Mission in San Francisco. We started in 1965 and we've been offering delightful bread, cakes, pies, and cookies to happy customers ever since!\nIf you don't write any meta description, Google will automatically generate the snippet for you, but it might not be what you want to be displayed to searchers.\nDo not use the same meta description for different pages of the same site. Pages that have the same meta descriptions are competing with each other for ranking in the same keyword searches.\nAdd a Meta Description (Site Description)\u00a0for Home Page\n1. Go to your Strikingly site editor, click \"SETTINGS > \"Basic Info\".\n2. Put your description text in the \"Site Description\" box.\nAdd Meta Descriptions (Site Descriptions) for Individual Pages\nIf you have a multiple-page site, you can set a unique meta description for each individual page.\n1. Go to your site editor, and click \"MANAGE\" next to PAGES.\n2. Click the page's gear icon.\n3. Select \u201cSEO settings\u201d.\n4. Put your description text in the \"Meta Description\" box.\nAdd Page Titles for Individual Pages\n1. Go to your site editor, and click \"MANAGE\" next to PAGES.\n2. Click the page\u2019s gear icon.\n3. Select \u201cSEO settings\u201d.\n4. Put your title text in the \"Custom Title Tag\" box.\nPage title is different from page name. The page name appears on the site menu while the page title appears in the browser tab and search results.\nTips for page titles\nEach page should have a unique, descriptive, and relevant title.\nAdd your target keyword in the title.\nUse \"|\" to distinguish different parts of your title.\nAvoid using angle brackets, it could be invisible for search engines.\nThe length of the title should be less than 70 characters.\nFor more tips about improving your site\u2018s search engine ranking, visit Improve Search Engine Ranking (SEO).\nIn case you need assistance, shoot us a line at\u00a0support@strikingly.com\u00a0or\u00a0chat with us.\nWas this article helpful?\n13 out of 15 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

Where do my links go?\nYes! Click this link: http://www.strikingly.com/pro#styles-colors\u00a0You'll notice it automatically goes to the 7th section titled \"Style your site\" on the page.\nNote: These used to appear automatically in the address bar when scrolling, but we have disabled them because they affect other parts of the site.\nHow do I link a specific section by name?\nGo to your\u00a0site editor.\nFigure out the section's name from the left panel.\nConverting it, punctuation is ignored and hyphens are added, such as the \"Who are we?\" section becomes \"who-are-we\".\nAdd it to your link. If you have a custom domain, add #who-are-we, after your domain. For example, yourdomain.com/#section-name. If you have no domain connected, then it will be http://page.mystrikingly.com/#section-name.\nSend that link to friends -- this is a good way to let users \"jump\" down to a later section on your page.\nHow do I link a specific section by number?\nYou can also link to a section by its number! Just use http://www.yourdomain.com/#2 to go to the second section, or http://page.mystrikingly.com/#2 if you don't have a domain connected.\nNotes:\nBe careful! You do not need the \"s/pages/\" or \"/edit\" part in your link -- if you have this, it's because you are looking at the site inside the editor, rather than the live site.\nIf you are linking to a section on the SAME PAGE, you can simply put the latter part (just \"#2\" or \"#section-name\" in the \"URL:\" box when linking text or images!\nLinking to Specific Sections in a Multipage Site\nIf you want to add links to different sections in your site's navigation menu, go into your page manager and add an external link.\nClick on the setting gear and select the option to link to [Page & Sections] from the external link menu dropdown.\nSelect the page and section you want to link to and drag the external link to where you'd like it to show in your site's navigation menu.\nHave some questions?

What are the limits for blog posts?\nYou can publish an unlimited number of blog posts on Strikingly. There is no limit to the number of blog posts you can create. However, each blog post should not exceed 60,000 characters, including spaces, and paragraphs are recommended to be within 500 characters for optimal readability.\nHow can I change \"Read more\" to pagination, displaying page numbers like 1, 2, 3?\nUnfortunately, the option to change \"Read more\" to pagination is currently not supported in Strikingly. The \"Read more\" feature is designed to display new results while preserving the previous ones, unlike pagination, which replaces the previous results.\nHow can I make a blog post only accessible via a link?\nIf you want to restrict access to a specific blog post and make it accessible only to a select group of people, you can add a password to the blog post. Visit Add Password Protection To Blog Posts to learn more.\nWe hope that you find this feature useful!

They'll also receive a notification email when you ship their order or issue a refund. You\u2019ll receive email notifications when a new order comes in or when your stock is running low.\nNote: Emails that are sent from our platform but labeled with a free email address (Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail, Proton, etc) are more likely to be marked as spam or junk. Instead, we recommend using a custom domain email for \"From Email.\". If you already have a domain with us, check this guide to purchase your custom email. In case you have a custom email from a different platform, you'll need to authenticate it by following the steps in this guide.\nEmail notifications sent to you:\nOrder Placed - Sent when a new order is placed\nOut of Stock - Sent when product is out of stock\nEmail notifications sent to your customers:\nOrder Confirmed - Sent automatically after purchase\nOrder Completed - Sent automatically when an order is marked as completed\nOrder Refunded - Sent automatically when a refund is issued\nYou can preview what each email looks like by going to your Settings > Email Notification > Email Templates:\nHere's a sample preview:\nNote: Besides English, we also support French, Spanish, Japanese, and Chinese translations for emails. Find out how here, in our language guide.\nYou can\u2019t disable email notifications in this panel. But, you can customize the \"Order Completed\"\u00a0email by adding a note to your customers when completing an order. The notes you add will be included in the\u00a0Order Completed notification that's sent to your customer.\nEdit Email Templates for Order notifications\nIf you'd like to set a certain tone in the order notifications for branding consideration, or you'd like to send instant download links, you can do it through the \"Email templates\" (for Pro/VIP).\nEmail templates can be customized by following these steps:\nIn your Settings, go to Email Notifications > Show advanced options > Email Templates and click \"Edit\" on any of the order notifications.\nEdit the subject and the message body. Don't forget to hit \"Save\" when you're done!Sample edited template:\nNotes:\nThe subject and message body can be modified. However, the order details cannot be edited.\nIf you'd like to go back to the original template, you can do so by clicking \"Restore defaults\", then \"Save\".\nWe hope you'll find this article\u00a0useful!

This will make your site live, which means:\n1. It can be viewed by anyone who knows your site URL.\n2. Search engines will start indexing (listing) your site in their search results.\nHow does the publish button work?\nBefore you click the publish button for the first time, no one can find/stumble upon your site because it is hidden from all search engines! If you go to your strikingly URL, it will have the message \"This site is not yet published.\"\nAfter you click \"Publish\" for the first time, your site will be indexable (findable) by search engines. You can disable this in Settings > Show Advanced > Privacy & Legal:\nWhat is the difference between the saved version and the live version?\nAny changes you make in the editor are automatically saved. You also have the option to save manually by clicking on the \"Save now\" link located at the top of the left panel.\nThese changes are viewed through the \"Preview site\" button on the left panel:\nThe Live version is only updated when you click \"Publish.\"\nIf you have a custom domain, there might be a delay (between 5-15 minutes) before your live site is updated, but you can still view your site from the \"Preview\" button. This is because we are pushing your changes to our CDN which allows your site to be online and load fast anywhere in the world.\nHow do I hide my site after publishing?\n1. Pro users: Add a password to your site.\nThis will allow only people with the password to see the content. This will also block the content from Google until you remove the password. Go to Settings > Show Advanced > Privacy & Legal to set this up.\n2. All users: Click the \"Unpublish\" button.\nGo to your Dashboard > look for the site you want to unpublish > click the gear icon under the site name > select \"Unpublish\". Check out the visual tutorial here!\n3. All users: Clone your site.\nNote: This is a little complex. By following the steps above, you can unpublish your site and it will make your old link invalid. You can then start again with a new, unpublished site. When people find the old link, they will not be able to view any content. However, this method means that Google will still see the description you wrote in the site's Settings for a couple more days.\nNow, to clone your site, go back to your main Dashboard at strikingly.com > click the gear icon under the site name > select \"Clone\". The new site created is automatically brand new and has never been published. Then, go back and delete the old site or rename it to invalidate the URL.\nNote: Changes made to your website are saved automatically.\nIn case you need assistance, shoot us a line at\u00a0support@strikingly.com\u00a0or\u00a0chat with us.\nWas this article helpful?\n14 out of 16 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

There's a simple explanation.\u00a0 The URL uploader accepts video links in a specific format- you need to modify your videos. URL to the proper format see how below:\nVimeo\nDetermine your video to Vimeo's ID, go to the video's page, and look for the numbers after the slash (/).\nUnderlined in red is the video ID. The Strikingly video background upload accepts Vimeo URLs in the following formats:\nIn the following examples, (*) represents the name of the channel, and (XXXXXXX), is the video ID.\nvimeo.com/ XXXXXXX \u00a0(This is the most preferred and common video URL)\nvimeo.com/channels/*/ XXXXXXX\nvimeo.com/groups/*/videos/ XXXXXXX\nYouTube\nThe ID for your YouTube video is the sequence of letters and numbers found after \"v =\" in the video URL. For instance, in the following video URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-G59dzN-zo, the code after \"v =\" is the video ID, which in this example is Q-G59dzN-ZO.\nIn the case of YouTube shorts, the ID is located after \"www.youtube.com/shorts/\" in the URL. For example, in the short video URL: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/iU7m4OWfUoM, the ID is iU7m4OWfUoM.\nWhen adding your video's URL to the site editor, please ensure it follows this format: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXXXXXX, where XXXXXXX represents the unique video ID.\nIf you need assistance, shoot us a line at support@strikingly.com or chat with us.\nWas this article helpful?\n6 out of 6 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

Since search engines can't \"read\" images, alt text is a label that you add to your image so that search engines can read the image.

They won't help your site's ranking and might actually hurt you.\nTry to use descriptive, specific, and unique phrases.\nThe length of the alt text should be less than 125 characters.\nAdd Alt Text to Individual Images\nGo to the image you want to edit in your site editor.\nHover over the image and click \"Edit\".\nClick \"Add Alt Text\" to enter your alt text.\nClick \"Save\".\nAdd Alt Text to Gallery Images\nGo to the Gallery section in your site editor.\nHover over the section and click \"Manage Gallery\".\nFind and select the image.\nEnter your image title (alt text) under the \"Title\" field.\nAdd your image description under the \"Description\" field.\nClick \"Save\".\nFor more tips about improving your site\u2019s search engine ranking, visit Improve Search Engine Ranking (SEO).\nIn case you need assistance, shoot us a line at\u00a0support@strikingly.com\u00a0or\u00a0chat with us.\nWas this article helpful?\n3 out of 3 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

Here\u2019s a checklist to go through!\nDid you click publish?\nThe first time you hit publish, we make your site visible to the world via search. If you don\u2019t want to be visible, go to Settings > Advanced > Privacy & Legal to hide the site from Google.\nWhile in the editor:\nSite Basics-Did you change the title of your site? This shows up on your viewer\u2019s browser tab and is the default text if they bookmark you. Change this in Settings > Basic Info (and check out the other settings).\n-Did you change the Strikingly URL so you can share it easily or connect to a custom domain such as yourname.com? Also on Settings, you can do it through the Domains tab. Learn more about connecting a domain.\n-Are you using the font you want to use? Press the \u201cStyle\u201d button in the upper left panel > go to Fonts to make changes. You can change colors here as well.\n-Did you add titles and descriptions to the images, or make sure to empty the boxes when you didn\u2019t want to?\n-Scroll to the footer. Look at the social media links by clicking on them. By default, they will use the URL/custom domain of your page.\nYou can change this to your Facebook entity page or something else by changing the links there!\nCheck if they contain any extra spaces inside the text box.\nMenu and Links-Each template\u2019s menu is a little different. Some have it at the top, others on the side, and some templates have no navigation menu. Feel free to choose what navigation layout works for you by switching templates through Styles.\n-Scroll through your page to see if this is a logical order for sections to proceed. If not, reorder them with the menu on the left, by clicking and dragging the sandwich icon (the button with 3 horizontal lines).\n-Look at the names of the sections on the left-hand side to see if they are meaningful. (Sections are the chunks of the site you created with the \u201cAdd New Section\" button.) Remember that these are also what shows on your URLs, and you can link them directly. Learn more here.\n-Check the menu (if you have one) and see if the right items are showing. Is there a reason for someone to click on a menu item or to know they\u2019re on that item? You can click the gear icon inline with the section name on the left panel > check/uncheck the \"Show in Navigation\" option:\n-Do you want to link to an external webpage through the menu, such as a blog, a partner, or a website? If so, you can achieve it through the left panel. You can set external links below your section list by clicking \"Add new link\" under Advanced.\nSpacing\n-Look at your text boxes. Do they contain extra spaces on the top, bottom, or inside the text box? Did you press enter at strategic points in the paragraph so that you could space it out perfectly? Try not to do that, as it will not appear the same on mobile.-Did you \u201cremove\u201d all the images you don\u2019t want and \u201cempty\u201d all the text boxes you don\u2019t need? Empty text boxes and empty images will collapse on your live site.\nWhile in preview/live:\nUniqueness-Look at your copywriting. Is it bold and concise? Is it striking?-Look at all of the images. Are there any within the same section that could be cropped to a different size? Do they need some image effects? Hover over the image > click Edit > go to the image editor to change how it looks.\n-Are you using any of our stock images? Remember that other people may also be using these images, so you may want to use the image editor to make them look a little different, or upload your own. We\u2019ll get more images over time as well.\nFunctionality\u00a0-Scroll through your site and click all of the links. Do they work? Are there some things you forgot to link? Link them in the editor by hovering over the image > click Edit >\u00a0 click Add link. Learn more here.\n-Did you use the mailto: and tel: links so users can email or call you when appropriate? Learn more here.-Click the tablet and mobile buttons when checking the preview to see how your site looks on mobile!\nThe usual suspects are:\n1. Background images. Check your settings\u2014\u201cStretch\u201d usually works best as this covers the full background area, but you can use \u201cContain\u201d if you want the whole image to show. We also have other options you can find by clicking \"Background\" in the upper right corner of the section. For more details about the recommended background image sizes, check this article.\n2. Content in background images. If you have a logo, text, or other main content in your background, consider using a different section\u2014Big media, so that the full image always shows, or one with an image on a background, so you can upload the logo and background separately. If it\u2019s text, use a section with text and a background image if possible!\nSearch engine friendliness:\u00a0-Did you add your site to your email signature? This shows what you're doing, and what you believe in. As a bonus, the link helps with SEO.

To rank well in search results, it's important to use keywords in your content correctly.\nTips for Good\u00a0Keywords\nUse keywords the visitors would use, or you want search engines to relate to your site.\nDo not use irrelevant keywords or keyword stuffing. They won't help your site's ranking and might actually hurt you.\nTry to use descriptive, specific, and unique phrases. Make sure the content is also useful and easy to navigate for visitors.\nTry to add keywords in these places to improve the search engine optimization (SEO) for your website:\nSite domain \u00a0(if you don't have a domain yet, you can\u00a0purchase from us)\nURL page slugs\nSite/page title\nHeadings\nMeta descriptions (Meta tags)\nImage ALT tags\nPage's body content\nFAQ\nCan I add meta keywords tag?\nNo, because the site meta keywords tag is an outdated option that\u2019s useless for SEO, and in some cases can even hurt your search engine ranking.\nSearch engines, including Google, award higher rankings to websites that have:\nrelevant, reputable, and high-quality content;\nhigh user satisfaction;\npopular pages.\nIn this scenario, meta keywords do not noticeably influence SEO rankings anymore.\nIn fact, if meta tags are abused (keyword stuffing), your websites can suffer from search engines\u2019 punitive quality algorithm. Keyword stuffing is an old SEO practice where a webmaster adds a lot of irrelevant keywords on websites in order to jack up their site rank in the search results. This makes the site spammy and does not give relevant results to searchers.\nAll search engines now ignore keywords in their ranking algorithm, and some search engines even punish this by decreasing your ranking.\nHow long does it take for keywords to work?\nAdding keywords does not guarantee automatic updates or add the keywords in search results or affect your search engine ranking. It is determined by search engines and many factors, like quality, authority, etc. To speed up this process, you can:\n1. Verifying Google Search Console and Submitting Sitemap\u00a0or\u00a0request a re-index\u00a0using Google Search Console.\n2. Focus on quality content. Adding useful and relevant content is the best way to get those \u201corganic\u201d visits. Search engines will not rank your content unless it helps somebody.\n3. Do keyword research and create content. You can use tools like Semrush, and Keywords Everywhere to create content or better, blog posts.\nFor more tips about improving your site\u2019s search engine ranking, visit Improve Search Engine Ranking (SEO).\nIn case you need assistance, shoot us a line at\u00a0support@strikingly.com\u00a0or\u00a0chat with us.\nWas this article helpful?\n10 out of 11 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

To turn this into a multi-language site (e.g. English and Japanese), you can do the following:\n1. Activate the Language Switcher in either site\u2019s Settings > Advanced > Multi-language.\n2. After activating, you can add multi-language versions of the current site. You can set a language label and a flag icon for each site.\n3. Click \u201cAdd New Language\u201d and select the language you\u2019d like to add.\n4. Select how you\u2019d like to add the new language site. There are 3 different ways you can do this:\nOption 1: Connecting an existing site URL\nYou can directly connect to another site if you have already created a site in the target language. The site can be a Strikingly site or a non-Strikingly site.\nOption 2: Clone the current site & manually translate\nIf you do not have a created foreign site, don\u2019t worry we\u2019ve got you covered! You can select the second option - your current site will be cloned and you need to manually translate the new site afterward.\nOption 3: Clone the current site & auto-translate\nNote: this is a VIP feature. We\u2019ve adopted Google Translate to help you create a multi-language site within minutes. You\u2019ll need to select the site sections you wish to be auto-translated.\nOnce you confirm, your site will be cloned first, and then its content will be automatically translated. You\u2019ll need to review and publish the newly-created site before it becomes visible to your site visitors.\nNote: You can edit other parts of your current site during the cloning. We will notify you once the cloning process is complete.\nWhat are the available languages for the multi-language site option?\nOur Language Switcher supports all languages, and you can choose from the list of default languages provided. If the language you want to use is not listed, then you can select \"Other\" and manually write the language name. This way, you can create a multi-language site tailored to your needs.\nWhat content does auto-translation cover?\nPage sections content (selected and required by default)\nSite Menu\nText\nButton text\nStore and Portfolio (optional)\nBlogs (optional)\nSEO-related content: including page URLs, titles, meta descriptions & image alt texts (optional)\n5. Once you save these settings and publish your site, both sites will show a language switcher dropdown menu with flags! This dropdown menu links the two sites to each other, so your visitor can always switch the language as needed.\nNote: This Language Switcher applies to all associated sites simultaneously. Once you apply the settings to one site, it automatically applies the same settings to all sites in the Language Switcher list, so the sites are all synced.\nNote: If you have a custom domain, you can connect the new language site to a subdomain, such as fr.myexamplesite.com. (If you've purchased your domain on Strikingly, you can read this guide to set up subdomains.)\nEmail support@strikingly.com or chat with us if you have any questions!\nWas this article helpful?\n25 out of 30 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

Let's try to fix it!\"Problem Occurred While Saving Your Page\"\n1. Do you have your site editor opened in different tabs or browsers? Are there two people editing your site at the same time?\nIf you do, I'd recommend closing the other tabs/browsers. Having your editor open in two or more windows can cause conflict in the system since we also auto-save. It could prevent the system from saving the right version.\n2. Is your internet connection working properly?\nAn intermittent connection can cause this error. You may not immediately notice it, but sometimes, your internet connection \"skips\" and if that happens, your connection with our servers is lost--resulting in this error.\n3. Have you tried using a different browser/computer or incognito window to edit your site?\nIt may be a browser issue. If you have several extensions installed on your browser, this may affect your site editor, so we'd recommend trying it out on a different browser or computer or using incognito/private browsing mode.\nIf you answered \"YES!\" to all these questions, and you're still seeing the error, email us at support@strikingly.com\u00a0or chat with us.--we'd really love to help!\nWas this article helpful?\n0 out of 0 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

Focus on creating valuable, information-rich content that your readers will find useful, rather than posts stuffed with keywords. The keys to improving your search engine rankings are quality and relevance.\nThe four factors that correlate with higher-quality content are:\nLongform content (holistic and relevant)\nMedia-rich content (images and videos)\nEasy-to-read content\nSemantically comprehensive content\nBesides the quality of the content itself, Strikingly\u2019s Simple blog has a handful of ways that can clue search engines into the \u201crelevancy\u201d of your blog post to the subject you\u2019re writing about.\nTitles/Headings and subheadingsThe titles/headings and subheadings in your blog posts are automatically formatted as H1 or H2 tags, respectively. The H title tags have long been important to search engines as indicators of what a page of content is about.\nPermalinksPermalinks are the permanent URLs to your blog posts. Including the \u201ckeyword\u201d you\u2019re writing your article around in the URL is another way to demonstrate to search engines that your post is relevant to the subject your blog is about. In the Simple Blog, the permalink for your blog is synced with the title of your blog. For example, if your blog post title is \u201c10 Ways To Improve Your Writing\u201d, the link to your blog post will be \u201cyourwebsiteurl.com/blog/10-ways-to-improve-your-writing\u201d. To help your blog post rank higher on search engines, make sure your title is descriptive of what you\u2019re writing about. Or you can opt to customize the permalink if you'd like to use other keywords that are relevant to the subject.\nImage Alt TagsImage Alt tags/texts are a way for search engines to understand what an image is. To write an alt tag for the image in your blog post, click on the image, and you\u2019ll see a text box to place \u201cAlt Text\u201d into.\nWrite a short description of what the image is. For example, for the image above, I can write \u201cLight breakfast idea #1: Coffee and Bread\u201d.\nMeta description A meta description is the snippet of information below the link of a search result. Its purpose is to describe the contents of the page to search engines and your potential audience. You can think of the meta description as a way to entice readers who are searching online for information to click on your post.\nTo write your meta description, click on your blog post settings. The description should be a short and catchy summary of what your post is about.\nSocial SharingTo search engines, the number of social shares that a blog post receives is an indication of the quality of the blog post. Be sure to enable the social media feature at the bottom of your posts.\nIn case you need assistance, shoot us a line at support@strikingly.com or chat with us.\nWas this article helpful?\n7 out of 7 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

Headings help visitors and search engines understand what the page is about.\nTips for Heading Tags\nUse keywords the visitors would use, or you want search engines to relate to your site.\nDo not use the same keywords in heading tags across different pages on your site.\nWhen you add a title in the editor, heading tags are applied automatically and added to the page's code.\nAdd an H1 Heading Tag\nAdd H2, H3, H4 Heading Tags\nChecking the Heading Tags\nAdd an H1 Heading Tag\nTo add an H1 tag, add a title on the first section of that page. The H1 tag acts as the title of each page.\nAdd H2, H3, H4 Heading Tags\nTo add an H2, add titles on the other sections. H3 for the item title text, H4 for the subtitle for all the sections of that page.\nChecking the Heading Tags\nYou can use the browser inspect tool to check which heading tags are:\nRight-click the text you want to check.\nSelect \"Inspect\".\nA panel appears on the right side (or the bottom side) and you can see the heading tag is H2.\nFor more tips about improving your site\u2019s search engine ranking, visit Improve Search Engine Ranking (SEO).\nIn case you need assistance, shoot us a line at\u00a0support@strikingly.com\u00a0or\u00a0chat with us.\nWas this article helpful?\n0 out of 3 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

Confirm your action by clicking \"Confirm Unpublish.\"That's it, and you're done! Your site is now unpublished.\nNotes:\nUnpublishing your site means it won't be viewable by anyone.\nYour site may still come up on Google Search. It usually takes up to a few days before Google re-indexes your site, but don't worry! If anyone clicks on your site's URL, they will see a page warning: \"This page is currently under construction.\"\nIf you have a domain connected to your unpublished site, it will still be connected should you decide to publish the site again.\nIn case you need assistance, email us at support@strikingly.com\u00a0or\u00a0chat with us.\nWas this article helpful?\n16 out of 16 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

You can use subdomains for different sections of your website. For example, if you have a website just for shopping, which is part of your website yourdomain.com (root domain), you might use the subdomain shop.yourdomain.com.\nThe most popular subdomain is www. Here's how to connect the www domain and root domain to your main site: Connecting a Domain to Your Strikingly Site via cPanel\nFor other subdomains, this guide will walk you through if your domain registrar uses cPanel to manage DNS records. You can send this tutorial to your registrar if you need help.

Codes are pretty sensitive and a missing or misplaced period or other punctuation/letter/character can cause your code not to work.\nIf you've set your eye on a specific app and want to integrate it into your Strikingly site, look for its HTML/embed code. Contact your app's support people and ask them to help you find it. If they're not useful, contact us!\u00a0We love to find ways to help!\nThe HTML embed section is exclusive to apps that are displayed within your webpage. If you want to add JavaScript codes for other apps, you need to use the custom code section.\nIn case you need assistance, shoot us a line at support@strikingly.com or chat with us.\nWas this article helpful?\n15 out of 17 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

Please cancel your plan, delete all your sites, and read this: Closing your Strikingly Account. Contact us at support@strikingly.com\u00a0or chat with us.\nHow do I change plans?\nTo change your plan, check out this article. Features that are not in your new plan (if you're moving from Pro to Limited) will automatically be removed.\nIf you're having trouble, email us or click the help widget. Send us a message, and we'll help you change/cancel your plan.\nCan I cancel my plan/subscription?\nYes, you can. By doing this,\u00a0the premium features or the existing plan features you have will be stripped of your sites.\nCan I still edit my sites after canceling my plan?\nCertainly! You will still have access to the site editor and can continue making modifications to your sites. Only the premium features will be removed.\nHow do I cancel my plan/subscription?\nYou can cancel or change plans on your My Account page. If you bought or claimed a domain, you will be able to keep the rights to your domain, and the registration fee will not be refunded. You can continue managing your domains from your Domains page.\nSadly, we don't process refunds. If you're having trouble or want more information, please send us a message!\nWhat are the steps to cancel my plan?\n1. To revert to the Free plan, click \"Cancel Plan\" on your My Account page.\n2. Confirm the cancelation by clicking the \"Confirm Cancel Plan\" button:\n3. Follow the cancelation prompts on the succeeding pages.\u00a0Note: If there's no cancelation before the next billing date, the system will automatically charge the account for the plan renewal.\nWhat are the premium and Pro features?\nWhen you downgrade, the following premium features will be stripped off your sites:\nExtra sites. You can publish unlimited free sites regardless of what plan you're in. Limited plans give you 2 Limited sites (sites with domains), and the Pro plan will allow you to have 3 Pro sites (sites with Pro features). If you have a one-click site, it's not counted against this limit.\nCustom domain. Domains and subdomains connected to your sites will be disconnected, and they will be reverted to have the former/default Strikingly URL i.e. name.mystrikingly.com.\nDo not worry about deleting APPS or the Pro Sections (such as the slider)! They will automatically be hidden as you downgrade. Some apps, like Mailchimp, are Pro-only apps, and HTML sections are always Pro-only. Other apps are available for all users. These are some of the Pro features:\n(Pro) Strikingly branding. The Strikingly branding will now be visible again on the footer of each site.\n(Pro) Custom Code. All custom HTML, CSS, and Javascript code in Header and Footer code settings will be removed on all sites.\n(Pro) Privacy. Passwords on sites will be removed automatically.\n(Pro) Mobile Actions.\n(Pro) Social Feed\n(Pro) Ability to add up to 100 pages per site.\n(Pro) Slider section.\n(Pro) HTML, MailChimp (from the App Store & HTML section). These integrated features will be hidden from the live site.\nYou will find a complete list of the features included in your premium plan on our pricing page, or chat with us, and we'll be happy to provide you with a rundown of the features used on your site.\nWas this article helpful?\n16 out of 30 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

You can use subdomains for different sections of your website. For example, if you have a website just for shopping, which is part of your website\u00a0yourdomain.com\u00a0(root domain), you might use the subdomain\u00a0shop.yourdomain.com.\nThe most popular subdomain is www. Here's how to connect the www domain and root domain to your main site: Connecting a Wix Domain to Your Strikingly Site.\nFor other subdomains, this guide will walk you through. You can send this tutorial to your registrar if you need help, or if you'd like us to connect your domain for you, send us the info here!\nStep 1: Connect to Your Custom Domain on Strikingly\nStep 2: Find Wix's DNS settings\nStep 3: Add a CNAME record on Wix\nStep 4: Wait for the Records to Take Effect\nStep 1: Connect to Your Custom Domain on Strikingly\n1. Go to your Strikingly site editor and click SETTINGS > Domains.\n2. Enter your subdomain in the \"Connect a Domain You Already Own\" box, such as \"shop.yourdomain.com\" (without https:// or http:// or /).\n3. Click UPDATE.\n4. Choose \"Others\" for your domain provider, and click \"Start Configuration\".\nYou will see a pop-up that displays the records you'll need to set in your domain settings.\nNote: Type your domain in lowercase to avoid the \"Page not found\" error when accessing your site.\nStep 2: Find Wix's DNS settings\n1. Sign in to your Wix account.\n2. Mouse over the \"person icon\" at the top left.\n3. Click \"Domains\".\n4. Click the  icon next to your domain.\n5. Select \"Manage DNS Records\".\nStep 3: Add a CNAME record on Wix\n1. Go to the \"CNAME (Aliases)\" section.\n2. Click \"+ Add Record\".\n3. Click \"Got it\" in the pop-up message.\n4. In the \"Host Name\" field, enter subdomain.yourdomain.com (this domain is just an example, please change it to your subdomain).\n5. In the \"Value\" field, enter subdomain.yourdomain + .s.strikinglydns.com\nsubdomain.yourdomain\u00a0in the value field \"subdomain.yourdomain\u00a0+ .s.strikinglydns.com\" should be your subdomain and domain name. Here are some examples of how the value should be:\nYour domain is example.com\u00a0and your subdomain is\u00a0shop, the value should be:\u00a0shop.example.com.s.strikinglydns.com\nYour subdomain is\u00a0blog.abc.net, the value should be:\u00a0blog.abc.net.s.strikinglydns.com\nYour subdomain is\u00a0info.yourdomain.com, the value should be:\u00a0info.yourdomain.com.s.strikinglydns.com\n6. In the \"TTL\" field, select 1 hour.\n7. Click \"Save\".\n8. Click \"Save Changes\" in the pop-up message.\nStep 4: Confirm your setup is complete\nAfter you\u2019ve confirmed the above setup, go back to your Strikingly site editor and click the \"I've fixed, check again\" button in the pop-up.\nIf you've configured your DNS settings correctly, the pop-up will close and the domain status will show as \"connected\".\nIf you haven't configured your DNS correctly, the pop-up will display the error status. You should go back to step 3 to reconfigure the DNS records correctly.\nStep 5: Wait for the Records to Take Effect\nNow that you've set up the domain records. Please allow a few up to 48 hours for the changes in the domain records to take effect globally. Once it's done, HTTPS/SSL will be automatically activated within 24 hours.\u00a0Be sure to clear your browser cache before you check to see if the domain is working.\nRelated Articles:\nConnecting a Wix Domain to Your Strikingly Site\u00a0(for www and root domain)\nLive Site Error \"Page not found\"\nLive Site Error: \"Your connection is not private/secure\"\nTroubleshooting: Site is Down\nStandard Troubleshooting Steps\nIf your site doesn't go online after 48 hours, contact us at support@strikingly.com\u00a0or\u00a0chat with us and include a screenshot of your domain settings so we can help!\nWas this article helpful?\n0 out of 0 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

Different roles have different levels of access to your site:\nRole\nDescription\nAdmin\nAn Admin has the same level of access as the site owner, with two exceptions. The site Admin cannot delete the site and cannot add/remove Teammates. The Admin can make any edits, delete any content within the page, write blog posts, manage the store, manage events, change site settings, and view form responses and analytics. You can also give them permission to publish the site. Make sure you only invite people you trust!\nEditor\nSite Editors can make any changes to your site except events (booking section) and store management (the features under Simple Store including Order, Product, Shipping...). Site Editors also do not have access to site analytics, the settings panel, or view form responses.\nStore Manager\nStore Managers can edit products and change your store settings. They can also view and manage orders, including completing, canceling, and refunding orders. They may not edit other site content or blog posts. (You can also optionally allow them to publish new products.)\nBlogger\nUnder the blogger role, your teammate will be able to write and manage blog posts. You can choose whether they can publish the blog posts or not.\nAgent\nCan access the Audience page of the site, and view and respond to Live Chats! Useful if you're handling tickets or leads via our Live Chat function. Agents can also view Audience-related information like form responses, site members, and can send individual messages to your audience via email.\nPublish rights\nFor each Teammate, you can also indicate whether each role can publish changes or not.\n6. Click \"SEND INVITATION\".\n7. Your teammates need to accept the invitation from their email to gain access to your site.\nCheck their \"Spam\" or \"Updates\" folder if they can't find the invitation email. If they don't yet have a Strikingly account, they'll be prompted to create one and set a password. If they already have a Strikingly account, they just need to log in.\nWhen your teammate accepts your invitation and logs in to Strikingly.com, your site will show up in their dashboard, where they can edit or manage it. For example, this is how the admin role will see:\nThis is how the blogger role will see:\nNote: Only the site owner can add collaborators.\nHave some questions?

What the \"Show in iFrame\" checkbox does is essentially put the code you pasted/wrote in its own little \"window\" so that it can be sure to be visible and not affect any of the other code on the page.\nAs a general rule:\nMainstream HTML embeds (Twitter, Facebook) do not need the box checked.\nAny code you wrote that has all of the proper closing tags, such as </example> does not need the box checked.\nAny code that shows another website directly on your Strikingly site may need the box checked.\nSometimes, it's necessary to check this box in order for the page or section to work at all!\n\"Show in iFrame\" affects mobile compatibility.\u00a0Since using an iframe is a little like looking at the content through a window, the user's computer is not interacting with that content directly and doesn't always know how to respond to it.\nMore on why sites may not be showing correctly on mobile.\nUse the \"Preview\" button to see your section live and on different devices or screen sizes.Remember that what is in the editor is not necessarily what your visitors will see.\nIn case you need assistance, shoot us a line at support@strikingly.com or chat with us.\nWas this article helpful?\n2 out of 3 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

This is to make sure your site doesn't go offline and allow for more time to make a renewal payment (in case of decline).\nIf the domain doesn't set to auto-renew or we fail to charge your card on file, your domain will expire and your site will go down (Renew an Expired Domain). Eventually, your domain will be released to the market.\nBefore You Renew\nYour domain\u2019s renewal is separate from your website subscription renewal.\nIf you picked up a domain name for free with our Yearly (or higher) plans, you won't have to pay anything for the first year. But starting from the second year, you will be charged $24.95 (or more) every year for maintaining your domain.\nDomain renewal normally costs $24.95. The price may vary according to your domain's TLD/extension ie .com, .net, .biz, .fr, etc.\nWe will send emails to the email address listed in your domain contact information before we collect payment for renewing your domain. You will receive 2 reminder emails, 30 days and 5 days before your domain expires. You can update your billing information or disable the renewal.\nEven if you turn off the option for auto-renewal, you will still receive reminder emails from ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers), the organization responsible for managing the registrar market. These emails are necessary to keep you informed about the status of your domain renewal.\nOn this page:\nEnable the Auto-Renewal\nDisable the Auto-Renewal\nRenew an Expired Domain\nCheck Your Contact Information and Renewal Date\nEnable the Auto-Renewal\n1. Go to\u00a0your Strikingly Dashboard.\n2. Select your domain and click \"SETTINGS\".\n3. Check the box before \"Auto renew my domain\".\nDisable the Auto-Renewal\nIf you no longer want to keep the domain, you can disable auto-renew or contact us at least 7 days before the renewal date.\n1. Go to\u00a0your Strikingly Dashboard.\n2. Select your domain and click \"SETTINGS\".\n3. Uncheck the box before \"Auto renew my domain\".\n4. Click \"DISABLE ANYWAY\" on the pop-up warning.\nNote: Even if you turn off the option for auto-renewal, you will still receive reminder emails from ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers), the organization responsible for managing the registrar market. These emails are necessary to keep you informed about the status of your domain renewal.\nRenew an Expired Domain\nIf your domain expires, there is a grace period of 0 to 40 days (although some domains may not have a grace period). During this period, you can still renew your domain through Strikingly. To update your billing information, please visit this link. Here are the steps to reactivate your expired domain:\n1. Go to\u00a0your Strikingly Dashboard.\n2. Select your domain and click \"SETTINGS\".\n3. Click \"REACTIVATE NOW\" to renew your domain.\nNote: If you fail to renew your domain during the grace period, it will enter the redemption period, which will involve additional fees to renew. In such a case, you can reach out to us at support@strikingly.com or through chat, and we will help you to redeem your domain.\nCheck Your Contact Information and Renewal Date\n1. Go to\u00a0your Strikingly Dashboard.\n2. Select your domain and click \"SETTINGS\".\n3. The contact info and registration info are shown on the left.\nIn case you need assistance, shoot us a line at\u00a0support@strikingly.com\u00a0or\u00a0chat with us.\nWas this article helpful?\n27 out of 28 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

If the images remain in the search result after the site is removed, you can send us the image link and ask us to delete the image from our servers. Some images stay on the servers for a period of time, even after the site is deleted.\nRemove your personal information from Google.\nUnpublish your website or remove the content from your site.\nRestrict your site access, like using a password to protect your website or setting your page to member-only.\nFAQ:\nQ: Is it possible to block traffic to my site from another specific website?\nNo, this is currently not possible.\nQ: Is it possible to share my website with someone without publishing it?\nYes, you can share the preview without publishing.\nIn case you need assistance, shoot us a line at support@strikingly.com or chat with us.\nWas this article helpful?\n4 out of 5 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

What if I leave Strikingly?\nUnfortunately, we don't allow exporting of sites yet. We do hope to have this function in the future!\nIf you are moving away from Strikingly...\nWe will miss you! You can downgrade your plan to \"free\" and keep your site as a free siteurl.mystrikingly.com site, or delete it altogether. You will have to rebuild your site elsewhere if you've changed platforms!\nIf you bought a domain through Strikingly, you can keep the rights for that domain. You can still access the domain dashboard to manage your domain.\nIf you want to transfer that domain away from us (usually not necessary), let us know at support@strikingly.com (learn more from Transferring Domains Away from Strikingly). The emails you set up for that custom domain will no longer be valid, so you'll have to set up email hosting with your new registrar or with Google Workspace.\nIf you no longer want that domain, make sure it is not attached to any site, and it will not be renewed at the end of the expiration date. Unfortunately, we are unable to refund you for the fee you've paid for the year, so feel free to use the domain while you can! Visit Managing your Strikingly Domains.\nCan I delete my whole account?\nWe can delete accounts for free users. Contact us at support@strikingly.com or chat with us. If you're on a plan, you'll have to downgrade first!

In this sense, the score that you get from Google\u2019s PageSpeed test does not tell you how fast your site actually loads, but how your site fares based on Web Optimization rules that advance the rendering and execution of front-end codes (HTML, CSS, etc).\nHowever, many of these rules are rather outdated for modern websites. If you run the test against major websites like Facebook, Microsoft, and Yahoo, you will get equally low scores.\nOne useful recommendation from Google PageSpeed is the\"Optimize Image\" section. These are often a major cause of slow websites. Compressing your images before uploading may improve your PageSpeed. Check out these image compression services and see what works for you:\nTiny PNG\nSmush.it\nPhotoshop and/or other photo editing software\nWe also constantly update our site rendering technology to improve speed when testing with Google PageSpeed Insights. The majority of Strikingly sites now score over 90% on the Google PageSpeed test.\nNote:\nYou may have to run the test a few times to see improved scores! This forces the site to be recached, which improves load times around the world.\nIf you add any third-party scripts or custom code, that may take extra time to load and run, and this may decrease your PageSpeed score.\nVisit more tips for Improving Your Site Page Load Speed.\nW3C Compliance\nFull compliance with W3C is not a strict requirement to make your website SEO-compliant. W3C compliance simply implies that the HTML and CSS code that your website built is compliant with the standards set by the W3C.\nThere are several modern, advanced website rendering techniques used by Strikingly that the validator doesn\u2019t understand, like lazy loading. It\u2019s possible that if you load your site on W3C validators, it will tag lazy loading JavaScript as an error.\nIf you want your site to rank high in SEO, make sure that your site is regularly updated, has high-quality and relevant content, and gets quality backlinks by sharing and distributing your site.\nIn case you need assistance, shoot us a line at support@strikingly.com or chat with us.\nWas this article helpful?\n8 out of 9 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

You can use subdomains for different sections of your website. For example, if you have a website just for shopping, which is part of your website\u00a0yourdomain.com\u00a0(root domain), you might use the subdomain\u00a0shop.yourdomain.com.\nIf you have a Strikingly Domain, we'll automatically hook it up for you, you just need to add the domain to your website. Each domain you buy from Strikingly has an unlimited number of subdomains. (We cannot set up directories, such as domain.com/directory.)\nIf you have a third-party domain intended for subdomain use, visit Connecting Subdomains to Your Strikingly Site. If you don't have a domain yet, you can\u00a0Buy & Register Your Own Custom Domain.\nCreate Subdomain by connecting it\u00a0to Your Site\n1. Go to your Strikingly site editor and click SETTINGS > \"Domains\".\n2. Put your custom subdomain in the \"Connect a Domain You Already Own\" box, such as \"info.yourdomain.com, shop.yourdomain.com, blog.yourdomain.com, etc.\" (without https:// or http:// or /).\n3.

Check out our example of a multiple-page site here. Everyone can now use this feature. Our Free and Limited plan users can add up to 5 pages, while our Pro and VIP plan users can take advantage of up to 100 pages.\nHere's how you can create a multiple-page site Strikingly!\nBefore You Begin\nIf your site is live, we recommend cloning your main/homepage site first and working off the copy to prevent changes affecting your site visitors. To clone your site, click the gear and select \"CLONE\":\nNote: Cloning your site will not transfer your form data, Simple Blog posts, or Simple Store data.\nAbout Multiple Pages\nYou can add up to 100 pages on your multiple-page site (for Pro and VIP plan users).\nYour section-level navigation menu will be replaced with a page-level navigation menu\nYou can\u2019t use different templates for different pages on your multiple-page site - this is to maintain design consistency throughout the pages on your site\nWe currently allow for one social feed\nStep 1: Activating Multiple Pages\nGo into the editor and click \"Add Another Page\" from the left panel.\nConfirm the action by clicking on \"Activate Multiple Page\".\nStep 2: Adding Pages\nAfter you\u2019ve activated the multiple page mode, you\u2019ll see a new drop-down option where \"Manage Pages\" is nested under and \"MANAGE\" above the page drop-down. Both options will take you to the page manager, where you can manage, add, delete, and hide your pages. Click either [Manage Pages] or [MANAGE] to add pages.\nSelect the option to [Add New Page], rename your new page, and repeat until you\u2019ve added all your new pages to the site.\nYou can always return to the Page Manager to rename, reorder, add, or delete pages. Once you\u2019ve set up your pages, click [Back to site design] to add content to your new pages.\nNote: The character limit for a page name is set to 31 characters. This is to ensure compatibility and readability across various devices, particularly within the navigation bar. Longer names can sometimes lead to formatting issues or may not display correctly on certain screens. Also, shorter names are often more user-friendly and easier to remember.\nStep 3: Adding Content to New Pages\nNow that you\u2019re back in the section editor, start adding content and moving sections around each page.\nTo add new sections to a page, click the Page Selector to choose which page you want to add content to.\nAnd then, add or delete sections in the left panel as you would normally.\nHow do I move a section to another/new page?\nYou can easily move sections around from page to page on your multiple-page site. Go to the section you\u2019d like to move around and click the gear icon beside the section title and click \"Move to page\".\nSelect the page you want to move the section to, and viol\u00e0!\nStep 4: Setting Up Domain and Linking for Your Multiple-Page Site\nSetting Up Page Domains:We automatically generate domain paths (or URLs) from each page title for you. For example, if your domain is http://sunnysideup.mystrikingly.com, and then your page titled \u201cAbout Us\u201d will have the URL http://sunnysideup.mystrikingly.com/about-us. The same goes for each of the pages you\u2019ve added to your multiple-page site - the links are automatically created for all your pages.\nLinking to Sections and Pages:If you want to link to a specific page of your site - the link will look like this:\nwww.yourdomain.com/the-page-title\nFor example, my domain is http//:sunnysideup.mystrikingly.com, and the page I want to link to is \u201cEggnog Blog\u201d. My URL will be:\nhttp://sunnysideup.mystrikingly.com/eggnog-blog\nIf you want to create a link to a specific section on a specific page, this is the link structure:\nwww.yourdomain.com/your-page-title/#2\nFor example, I want to link to the second section on the SSUP Seoul page, and this is what my link will look like:\nhttp://sunnysideup.mystrikingly.com/ssup-seoul/#2\nStep 5: Reverting Back to a Single Page\nIf at any point you find yourself missing your old one-pager - just go back into your site [SETTINGS] > [Advanced] > [MULTIPLE PAGES] and click the \u201cRevert to single page\u201d button. When you revert your page, we'll hide all the pages, only leaving the content on your home page. But don't worry, you can always reactive multiple pages to restore all of your sections.\nDuplicate Pages\nIf you'd like to make a copy of one or more of your existing pages, you can do that by:\n1. Clicking \"Manage\" right above your page drop-down on the left panel of your site editor.\n2. Then click the gear icon next to the page you want to duplicate. Select \"Duplicate this page\" from the options.\n3. Click \"OK\" on the dialog box that says \"Are you sure you wish to duplicate the \"[Page name]\" page? ALL PAGE CONTENT WILL BE DUPLICATED.\"\nNotes:\nDuplicated pages cannot be moved from one site to another.\nIf there is a blog or store on a page, cloning the page will duplicate the blog and the store, but not the store or blog contents.Since blog & store sections are ways to show the contents of the blog/store, those sections will be cloned but the contents are the same.Example: The home Page has a Blog section with 5 blog posts:1. blog post A2. blog post B3. blog post C4. blog post D5. blog post EIf the Home Page is duplicated, the duplicate page will also have a blog section that contains the same blog posts. If you delete blog post A in the duplicate page, then it will be deleted from the original page (Home Page) too.\nWe hope you'll find this feature useful!

Many factors can affect the loading time of a page. Here are some ways to improve your site speed.\nUse the latest and supported browser\nCheck if your browser is the latest version. Strikingly supports the browser versions listed in this guide.\nOptimize your home page/landing page\nIt's said most visitors will leave if it takes time to load the homepage. Make sure to display only relevant, useful, simple content to attract your visitors to explore the rest of the pages.\u00a0 We recommend using fewer media, such as images, and videos on your homepage. Excessive information can be overwhelming, and the visitors may click away.\nKeep your content lightweight\nWe recommend no more than 5 sections on one page. If your page has more than 5 sections or one topic, distribute them across your new pages.\nUse \"Read more\", \"Check out my portfolio\" or \"Watch more videos\" to encourage site visitors to explore your site's content. This keeps your homepage clean and organized, also it's easier for your visitors to find the information they need.\nReduce image size\nStrikingly automatically reduce the size of images uploaded. However, if you have lots of images, it will make the site slow, especially on mobile devices and slower connections.\nJPEG is recommended because JPEG images are 80% smaller and have almost the same quality.\nIf your image needs a transparent background, use PNG. PNG files are best used for icons and logos.\nGIF is good for showcasing animated content, but it must be fully downloaded before they begin to play. We recommend converting it into a video with better quality and smaller sizes.\nReduce the number of videos\nAdd videos like YouTube or Vimeo, including background videos, can take a longer time to load, especially on mobile devices. It's best not to have more than one video on one page.\nIf you have more than one video, you can add video links to text, buttons, etc. For example, you can put one video and add a \"See All Videos\" button that links to a separate page with all the videos or your videos channel.\nUse special effects wisely\nSpecial effects such as Text + Button Slider, Banner Image Slider, or animation can enhance the visual appeal of your site. However, they can affect your page loading speed and impact your SEO. We recommend having 2\u20133 slides in one slider section, and not having more than one slider section on your page.\nMinimize custom code or third-party apps\nCustom code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) or third-party embedded code can cause your site to load slowly.\nWe recommend not putting them on your home page or adding links to a button, text, or image on the homepage that will navigate your visitors to them.\nAvoid custom font\nCustom fonts for headings are fine, try not to use custom fonts everywhere. Because if you use a font that does not exist on your visitor's device, then the font has to be downloaded first. It will take time to load the text.\nClear browsing history & cache\nWhen the site has been opened on the browser the first time, it will create a small image of the site, so it will be faster to pull up when you revisit the site. However, caches might also be the cause of why sites load slowly, especially when there are few published edits. This is because the browser would read that the small image it created before conflicts with the changes to the site. You may try using private mode or use a different browser.\nCheck for other causes\nThere could be more factors that can affect your site load speed. This includes:\nThird-party domain configuration\nDevice's memory and capacity\nLocal network firewalls\nAnti-virus software\nBrowser extensions\nYou may try using private mode or a different browser, disabling anti-virus software, switching to another network, restarting your router, etc.\nIn case you need assistance, shoot us a line at\u00a0support@strikingly.com\u00a0or\u00a0chat with us.\nWas this article helpful?\n6 out of 6 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

You'll see the window below, in which you can choose from 16 languages (other than English).\nSelect the Site Language that matches your site content, and click \"UPDATE\". Once you republish your site, the Site Language change will be reflected.\nHere are 2 contrasting examples to illustrate the effect of changing your Site Language -\n1. For this blog, the Site Language has NOT been changed to match the site content (simplified Chinese). Notice the English 'Return to site' button in the top left -\n2. But for this blog, the Site Language HAS been changed to match the site content (French). The 'Return to site' button in the top left is nicely in French -\nProviding a smoother, more cohesive user experience for that user's French audience :)\nPlease shoot any questions and feedback over to support@strikingly.com\u00a0or chat with us. And if you have requests for other languages, please post them in our Idea Forum.\u00a0Thanks, guys!\nWas this article helpful?\n3 out of 4 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

This setting only lets your site visitors see the address that they originally typed in the address bar instead of the real address of the site that they are viewing. Example:\nYou use select masked forwarding to forward yourdomain.com to http://page.strikingly.com or strikingly.com/page. When you visit yourdomain.com, the address bar shows yourdomain.com and you see your site content. However, the site looks strange on mobile.\nDoes Strikingly Domain support mask forwarding?\nThe answer simply is NO. Below are the reasons we do not support it.\nWhat is the problem with masked forwarding?\nSome domain registrars allow \"masked forwarding\" which uses a frame to include your Strikingly site onto your domain. Frames and iframes are special HTML elements that let you include one site in another site. This sounds like it would work but in fact, this causes many problems:\nBroken mobile site. Frames often cannot properly resize on mobile screens. This means Strikingly's mobile version won't be functional when your visitors view your site from a phone. Instead of seeing a mobile version of your site, you'll see your site displayed as how it is on a computer.\nPoor search engine optimization. Frames aren't smart enough to put SEO tags, images, and descriptions on the outer wrapping site, so as a result, your domain won't be able to pull that information when it gets indexed! Bad for your site's SEO.\nNo descriptions/icons are attached to the page. If you've uploaded a Facebook share image or favicon, these settings will only apply to the inner frame, so they won't be available from the outer wrapping site. As a result, your Facebook shares will not work properly.\nOutbound link security. If you have any secure external links from your site -- a link to a PayPal payment page, for instance -- those links may not function properly, since the link is only activated from within the frame and not from the browser. In this case, a service like PayPal may block your transaction because it cannot verify that you're accessing the payment page through a secure browser window!\nOK. Frames are bad. What's the solution?\nWe have guides to walk you through the proper way of connecting your domain to Strikingly! Click here to see how to do it.\nHow can I know if masked forwarding was used or not?\n1. Go to your domain registrar and check your domain settings.\n2. Check if the site loads using the naked domain.\n3. Check if the favicon load.\n4. Right-click and check for a \"View Frame source\".\nMasked forwarded site:\nNon-masked forwarded site:\n5. Check if the site has directories/sub-directories or paths.\nTry to click an item in the navigation menu, normally a site that is on masked forwarding will only show the domain/naked domain (www.domain.com).\nIn case you need assistance, shoot us a line at\u00a0support@strikingly.com\u00a0or\u00a0chat with us.\nWas this article helpful?\n0 out of 0 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

After you\u2019ve gone through the subdomain connection tutorial, refreshed, and waited for at least several minutes, you can check to see progress.\nNote: some domain registrars may take up to 48 hours to update! Double-check your settings and come back to the site later.\nIf you bought your domain from Strikingly, you could access your domain's DNS manager through \"MY DOMAINS\".\nGo to http://subdomain.yourdomain.com\nIf this tells you that no page exists or page not\u00a0found, then you probably haven\u2019t set up a CNAME for \u201csubdomain\u201d pointing to \u201cs.strikinglydns.com.\u201d See tutorial.a) check your spellingb) make sure you only have one CNAME for\u00a0\"subdomain\" (this could be anything you prefer)c) you may have to wait longer\nIf this redirects you to yoursiteurl.strikingly.com, you have set up subdomain forwarding. You should be using a CNAME instead! See tutorial.\nNOTE: We cannot set up directories such as yourdomain.com/directory. We can only set up subdomains. Thank you!\nStill a mystery?

However, if you prefer to use your root domain (yourdomain.com) instead of the www domain (www.yourdomain.com) as the main domain for your Strikingly site, you can achieve this by adding a CNAME record for the root domain.\nRequirement:\nA\u00a0Premium Account\u00a0from Strikingly\nA custom domain (if you don't have a domain yet, you can\u00a0purchase one from us)\nA Cloudflare account\nDo you want to use your root domain (yourdomain.com) as your main domain for your Strikingly site instead of the www domain (www.yourdomain.com)?\u00a0 You can do that by adding a CNAME record for the root domain. If your domain registrar does not allow this setup, you can use Cloudflare DNS settings. This guide will walk you through it.\nStep 1: Connect to Your Custom Domain on Strikingly\nStep 2: Add Your Domain to Cloudflare\nStep 3: Add a CNAME record on Cloudflare\nStep 4: Change Your Domain's Nameserver on your Registrar\nStep 5: Set up a URL forwarding with Cloudflare Page Rules\nStep 6: Wait for the records to take effect\nStep 1: Connect to Your Custom Domain on Strikingly\n1. Go to your Strikingly site editor, and click SETTINGS > Domains.\n2. Enter your custom domain in the \"Connect a Domain You Already Own\" box, such as \"yourdomain.com\". (without https:// or http:// or /).\n3. Click \"UPDATE\".\nNote:\nType your domain in lowercase to avoid the \"Page not found\" error when accessing your site\nStep 2: Add Your Domain to Cloudflare\n1. Sign in to your Cloudflare account or sign up if you don't have one (it's free).\n2. Click \"+Add site\" (if you just sign up, you can skip this).\n3. Enter your site:\n4. Select the free plan and Click \"Continue\".\n5. Wait for Cloudflare to finish scanning for existing DNS records.\nStep 3: Add a CNAME record on Cloudflare\n1. Look for existing CNAME and A records for www.\n2. Delete the existing CNAME and A records (only for www).\n3. Click \"+Add record\".\n4. In the \"Type\" field, select CNAME\n5. In the \"Name\" field, enter @\n6. In the \"Target\" field, enter cf-dns.strikingly.com\n7. Make sure the cloud under \"Proxy status\" is in orange.\n8. Click \"Save\".\n9. Click \"Continue\".\nStep 4: Change Your Domain's Nameserver on your Registrar\n1. You will be redirected to a guide on how to change your nameservers.\n2. Sign in to your domain registrar.\n3. Change the nameserver to Cloudflare's.\n4. Wait for the nameserver update. It can take a few hours to 24 hours.\n5. Once it's done, you can click \"Done, check nameservers\".\nStep 5: Add an A record for www and Set up a URL forwarding with Cloudflare Page Rules\n1. Go back to your Cloudflare account.\n2. Click on \"Website\" then click on \"DNS\".\n3. Create a DNS record for the www\u00a0subdomain.\nIt can be an A\u00a0record with the\u00a0192.0.2.1 value OR\nAn AAA record with the 100::\u00a0value.\nThe new DNS record must also have Cloudflare\u2019s proxy enabled (the cloud icon must be orange) to enact the Page Rule behavior you will create.\n4. Next, click on \"Rules\"\n5. Then go to \"Redirect Rules\u00a0\".\n6. Bulk Redirects > Create bulk redirect list.\n7. Name your redirect list and click \"Next\".\n8. Select \"Or, manually add URL redirects\"\n9. Add your redirect Source URL (for example: https://www.domain.com, http://www.domain.com...) and Target URL. Your target URL must include https:// before the root/naked domain. (for example: https://domain.com)\n10. Select Edit parameters\u00a0> Preserve query string,\u00a0Subpath matching,\u00a0and\u00a0Preserve path suffix.\n11. Select Next > Next > Continue to Redirect Rules.\n12. Select your list > Save and Deploy.\nStep 6: Wait for the records to take effect\nNow that you've set up the domain records. Please allow a few up to 48 hours for the changes in the domain records to take effect globally. Be sure to clear your browser cache before you check to see if the domain is working.\nNote:\nWe do not recommend using Cloudflare as a solution to HTTPS anymore. However, if you still want to use your root domain (yourdomain.com) as your main domain for your Strikingly site instead of the www domain (www.yourdomain.com), you can do that by adding a CNAME record for the root domain. Do this at your own risk, as this solution may prevent your other DNS records such as MX records from working properly.\nIf your site doesn't go online after 48 hours, contact us at support@strikingly.com\u00a0or\u00a0chat with us and include a screenshot of your domain settings, so we can help!\nWas this article helpful?\n2 out of 3 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

Why is my domain not connected?\nAfter you\u2019ve gone through the domain connection tutorial, refreshed, and waited for at least several minutes, you can check to see progress with this 2-step checklist.\nNote: Some domain registrars may take up to 48 hours to update! Double-check your settings and come back to the site later.\nIf you'd like us to connect your domain for you,\u00a0send us the info here!\u00a0If you bought a domain from Strikingly, it will automatically connect. Email support@strikingly.com if you\u2019re having trouble.\nStep 1. Go to http://yourdomain.com (change yourdomain to your domain name)\nDoes it work? If so, move to step 2! If not, keep reading:\nIf this redirects you to http://page.strikingly.com (or www.strikingly.com/page), then you have set up domain forwarding wrong. You want to forward from yourdomain.com to www.yourdomain.com, not to your Strikingly URL! Check our domain connection tutorial here.\nIf this tells you that no page exists or the page can\u2019t be found, then think about what you did during your tutorial.\na) If you used \u201cA Records\u201d at some point, it\u2019s very likely that you have A records for yourdomain.com that don\u2019t belong to us. You should delete the extra ones. Check our domain connection tutorial here.b) If you didn\u2019t use \u201cA Records\u201d, it\u2019s very likely that your domain forwarding isn\u2019t set up, or is not active yet. Double-check that you\u2019re forwarding (without masking) to www.yourdomain.com. Make sure you only have one CNAME for \u201cwww.\u201d Check our domain connection tutorial here.\nStep 2. Go to http://www.yourdomain.com (change yourdomain to your domain name)\nDoes it work? If so, you\u2019re good to go. If not, check if you have the correct CNAME record.\nIf this tells you that no page exists or the page can\u2019t be found, then you probably haven\u2019t set up a CNAME for \u201cwww\u201d pointing to \u201cwww.yourdomain.com.s.strikinglydns.com\u201d.\u00a0a) check your spellingb) make sure you only have one CNAME for wwwc) you may have to wait longer\nThis is rare to happen, but if it redirects you to http://page.strikingly.com (or www.strikingly.com/page), then you might have set up subdomain forwarding. You should be using CNAME instead! See the tutorial here.\nIf you can see your site, but are having mobile compatibility or viewing issues\u2026\nGo to \u201cview source.\u201d You can do this by pressing \u201ccmd+opt+U\u201d on Mac, or \u201cview\u201d \u201cdeveloper tools\u201d in the menu.\nIf the code is longer than a couple of pages, you should be good to go! Email us with a screenshot and your question.\nIf the code is less than a page, you are using \u201cmasked forwarding\u201d or \u201cframing.\u201d This is bad for SEO, mobile compatibility, and more, so use the tutorial to connect your domain properly.\nOther errors\nIf you see these pop-ups, read more:\"Framing is not allowed with a free account\" \u00a0\"Domain is invalid or already taken\"\nStill a mystery?\nEmail support@strikingly.com and we'll write back soon or chat with us!\nWas this article helpful?\n4 out of 5 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

How do I activate HTTPS / SSL?\nWhat if I'm loading HTTP assets using custom code?\nHow does Strikingly provide this service?\nMy SSL certificate expired, what should I do?\nStill not working?\nWhat is HTTPS / SSL and why does it matter?\nSSL (Secure Sockets Layer) lets visitors access your site over HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure), which means the connection between the visitor and your website is encrypted.\nThis gives your site visitors confidence that personal information cannot be viewed by any third party, especially when accepting credit/debit card numbers through your website (e-commerce site).\nGoogle favors sites using HTTPS in their search algorithm. Enabling HTTPS improves SEO (search engine optimization) ranking. Read more about it here.\nBrowsers will display a lock icon next to your URL.\nChrome:\nFirefox:\nMicrosoft Edge:\nSafari:\nIf you don't have a domain yet, you can\u00a0Buy & Register Your Own Custom Domain.\nHow do I activate HTTPS / SSL on my custom domain?\nAll Strikingly sites come with HTTPS / SSL automatically enabled, at no extra cost! This applies to both free sites and premium sites on a custom domain.\n[Legacy cases] If you used an old method to connect your custom domain:\nIf you registered your domain from Strikingly.com before April 5, 2018: Please contact support. We'll help you activate HTTPS for your Strikingly domain.\nIf you registered your domain with another registrar, and you connected your domain to Strikingly before November 1, 2017: You will need to update your domain's host records. Please consult the following instructions.\nI connected my domain to my site before November 2017. How do I activate HTTPS / SSL?\nYou may be using our old CNAME host which is dns.strikingly.com. To switch your domain to HTTPS, you\u2019ll need to change your domain's DNS settings (also called \"host records\") to use our new host. Here\u2019s how:\nDomain: yourdomain.com\nCNAME: www\nOld value/host: dns.strikingly.com\nNew value/host: www.yourdomain.com.s.strikinglydns.com (Format should be site URL + .s.strikinglydns.com)Note: yourdomain.com is an example and should be changed to your own custom domain.\nSubdomain: subdomain.yourdomain.com\nCNAME: subdomain\nOld value/host: dns.strikingly.com\nNew value/host: subdomain.yourdomain.com.s.strikinglydns.com (Format should be site URL + .s.strikinglydns.com)Note: subdomain.yourdomain.com is an example and should be changed to your own custom subdomain.\n(For example, if your domain is mysite.com, you will need to change your www CNAME setting from dns.strikingly.com to www.mysite.com.s.strikinglydns.com.)\nNote: SSL activation could take up to 48 hours to complete. Be sure to clear your browser cache and history before you check again to see if the site already loads on HTTPS.\nWhat if I'm loading HTTP assets using custom code?\nPlease keep in mind that if your site is on HTTPS, then\u00a0all external content\u00a0must also be on HTTPS for the browser to acknowledge that your site is \"Secure\". This means that if you load any custom scripts, images, or iframes by writing custom code, those URLs must also be using HTTPS.\nFor example, if your site is https://www.example.com, and you've added this custom code that loads a script using HTTP:\n<script src=\"http://www.facebook.com/sdk.js\"> </script>\nThen your site will not be \"Secure\". To fix this, you must use the HTTPS version of the script instead, like this:\n<script src=\"https://www.facebook.com/sdk.js\"> </script>\nHow does Strikingly provide this service?\nIn the past, installing HTTPS and SSL was a huge pain -- you'd have to purchase an SSL certificate and figure out how to install it on your server. This certificate might cost hundreds of dollars per year. Securing your website should not be this difficult.\nWe issue HTTPS and SSL from Let'sEncrypt -- it's 100% free, and we'll automatically handle everything for you, from installation to renewal. Let'sEncrypt is an initiative powered by some of the most established companies and organizations on the Internet, from Google to Facebook to Cisco to EFF, to make the entire web more secure.\nMy SSL certificate expired, what should I do?\nTypically, SSL certificates automatically renew themselves, so if you notice that your certificate is expired, please reach out to us at support@strikingly.com or chat with us. Our team will assist you in extending the validity of your SSL certificate and ensuring that your website remains secure.\nStill not working?\nIf it's been over 48 hours since you changed your domain host settings and your domain is still not loading properly on HTTPS,\u00a0contact us at support@strikingly.com\u00a0or\u00a0chat with us and include a screenshot of your domain settings so we can help!\nRelated article:\nLive Site Error: \"Your connection is not private/secure\"\nWas this article helpful?\n34 out of 35 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

However, you can redirect one of your domains to another. \u00a0If you don't have a domain yet, you can\u00a0Buy & Register Your Own Custom Domain.For example, if you want everyone who visits abc.com to go to xyz.com, or to go from abc.com to abc.com.au, you can set up \"URL forwarding\" for the secondary domain.\nStep 1 Decide which one is your main domain, which is the secondary domain.\nStep 2 Connect your main domain to your Strikingly site.\nStep 3 Set up your secondary forwarding\nStep 4 Wait for the records to take effect\nStep 1 Decide which one is your main domain, which is the secondary domain.\nMain domain - this is the one you want your users to end up with as the end.\nStep 2 Connect your main domain to your Strikingly site.\nStep 3 Set up your secondary forwarding\n1. Sign in to your secondary domain's registrar. For example, Godaddy, NameCheap, etc.\n2. Look for \"Domain forwarding\" or \"URL forwarding\" settings.\n3. Set up the following:\nAlias/Host/Name: @\nForward Type: Permanent (301)\nForwarded to/Redirects to: http://www.yourmaindomain.com (this URL is just an example, please change it to your main domain).\n4. If you also want to have www.yourmaindomain.com forwarded to your secondary domain, then set up the following:\nAlias/Host/Name: www\nForward Type: Permanent (301)\nForwarded to/Redirects to: http://www.yoursecondarydomain.com (this URL is just an example, please change it to your main domain).\nNote: make sure not to mask or use \"masked forwarding\". This creates many mobile and SEO issues.\nStep 4 Wait for the records to take effect\nPlease allow up to 48 hours for the changes in the domain records to take effect globally.\nIf your secondary domains don't forward to your main domain, contact us at\u00a0support@strikingly.com\u00a0or\u00a0chat with us\u00a0and include a screenshot of both domain settings so we can help!\nWas this article helpful?\n11 out of 11 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

Connect to a payment gateway. Start selling. Building your eCommerce site is really that simple. Here's our guide to help get your initial shop set up in minutes.\nStep 1: Adding the Simple Store section\nIf your template doesn't have a Simple Store section yet, you start on this step. If you do, you can skip to Step 2.\nGo to your site editor and click \"Add New Section\" in the left panel.\nSelect the \"Simple Store\" section from the section list.\nStep 2: Adding your Product\nClick on the \"Store\" tab from your site editor.\nClick the \"Add New Product\" button to start.\u00a0Note: Free and Limited users can list one product, and Pro users can add up to 300 products.\nChoose the type of product you want to sell (Physical, Service, or Digital products)\u00a0Fill out the product name and description fields. We recommend keeping the description short and simple. Then, upload your product images. Select a cover image and reorder it accordingly.Set your price. You can set the price and stock of your products without any worry, because you can modify the currency in the SETTINGS > Accept Payments later, in case you are not selling in USD.\nIf you\u2019re selling different product variations, let's say different colors or sizes, add the product variations by clicking the \"Add Variant\" button. You can add up to 30 variants per product.\nIf you need to collect shipping addresses from your customers, be sure to tick the Shipping option box:\n4. Hit \"Save,\" and voil\u00e0! You\u2019ve added a product to your Simple Store.\nStep 3: Accepting Payments\nClick on the \"Accept Payment\" tab from your Settings.\nYou can change the currency for your store by choosing from the Store Currency dropdown.\nAfter choosing the currency, you can now choose which payment option you want to add to your store. We currently support Stripe, PayPal, and Square. If your country doesn't support the following payment gateways, you can use Offline Payment instead.\u00a0Note: The products in your store will only show as \"Coming Soon\" if you haven't set up your payment gateway yet.\nStep 4: Final Steps\nAfter you've connected your payment gateway, your store is live! You can continue to tweak your Store settings and layouts, but you're already set to collect payments!\nAdditional changes you can make for your store:\nChange the language for your store's checkout\nSet up global shipping rates\nSet up shipping fee per item weight\nTweak email notifications to your customers\nImage Size Specifications - What is the proper size for an image?\nAnd more!\nGood luck with your store launch and let us know if you have any questions!\nWas this article helpful?\n5 out of 6 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

These are encoded by\u00a0the Unicode standard\u00a0and used as allowed by relevant\u00a0IDN protocols.\nTo add DNS records, the domain needs to be translated into English characters. To do the translation, you can use punycoder.com.\nFor example, \"domain.\u0440\u0444\" is domain.xn--p1ai, and \"\u4e2d\u6587.com\" is xn--fiq228c.com.\nAfter getting the translation,\u00a0 we proceed with the usual process:\n1. Add the A record. \"@\" pointing to\u00a054.183.102.22.\n2. Add the CNAME record. \"www\" pointing to\u00a0www.yourdomain.com.s.strikinglydns.com (change yourdomain.com to your domain name in Punycode, for example, www.xn--fiq228c.com.s.strikinglydns.com)\nRelated Articles: Connecting a Domain to Your Strikingly Site\nWas this article helpful?\n0 out of 1 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

You can send this tutorial to your registrar if you need help. Or if you'd like us to connect your domain for you,\u00a0send us the information here!\nStep 1: Connect to Your Custom Domain on Strikingly\nStep 2: Find Squarespace Domain's DNS settings\nStep 3: Add a CNAME record on Squarespace\nStep 4: Add an A record on Squarespace\nStep 5: Wait for the Records to Take Effect\nStep 1: Connect to Your Custom Domain on Strikingly\nGo to your Strikingly site editor, and click\u00a0SETTINGS > Domains.\nEnter your custom domain in the\u00a0\"Connect a Domain You Already Own\"\u00a0box, such as \u201cyourdomain.com\". (without https:// or http:// or /)\nClick\u00a0UPDATE.\nChoose Others\u00a0as your domain provider, and click \u201cStart Configuration\u201d.\nYou will see a popup that displays the records you'll need to set in your domain settings.\nNote: Type your domain in lowercase to avoid the \"Page not found\" error when accessing your site.\nStep 2: Find Squarespace Domain's DNS settings\n1. Sign in to your Squarespace account.\n2. In the Account Menu, click \"Account Dashboard\".\n3. Click the \u201cDomains\u201d tab.\n4. Click \u201cManage Domain Settings\u201d.\n5.

In the \"Type\" field of a blank row, select CNAME from the drop-down.\n3. In the \"Host\" field, enter www.\n4. Leave the \"Priority\" field blank.\n5. In the \"Data\" field, enter\u00a0www domain + .s.strikinglydns.com.\nwww domain\u00a0in the value field \"www domain\u00a0+ .s.strikinglydns.com\" should be your domain name.

Click \"Add\".\nTip: If you can't add a www CNAME record, look for existing CNAME and A records for www and delete them (only for www).\nStep 4: Add an A record on Squarespace\n1. In the \"Type\" field of a blank row, select A from the drop-down.\n2. In the \"Host\" field, enter @.\n3. Leave the \"Priority\" field blank.\n4. In the \"Data\" field, enter 54.183.102.22.\n5. Click \"Save\".\nStep 5: Confirm your setup is complete\nAfter you\u2019ve confirmed the above setup, go back to your Strikingly site editor and click the \"I've fixed, check again\" button in the pop-up.\nIf you've configured your DNS settings correctly, the pop-up will close and the domain status will show \"connected\".\nIf you haven't configured your DNS correctly, the pop-up will display the error status and you should go back to step 3 to configure the DNS records correctly.\nStep 6: Wait for the Records to Take Effect\nNow that you've set up the domain records. Please allow a few up to 48 hours for the changes in the domain records to take effect globally. Once it's done,\u00a0HTTPS/SSL will be automatically activated\u00a0within 24 hours.\u00a0Be sure to\u00a0clear your browser cache\u00a0before you check to see if the domain is working.\nRelated Articles:\nConnecting Subdomains to Your Strikingly Site\u00a0(e.g. info.domain.com, shop.domain.com)\nLive Site Error \"Page not found\"\nLive Site Error: \"Your connection is not private/secure\"\nTroubleshooting: Site is Down\nStandard Troubleshooting Steps\nIf your site doesn't go online after 48 hours, contact us at\u00a0support@strikingly.com\u00a0or\u00a0chat with us\u00a0and include a screenshot of your domain settings so we can help!\nWas this article helpful?\n0 out of 0 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

This guide will assist you in troubleshooting why your site or page is not indexed by Google.\n1. Check if Google has indexed your site\nIf you have recently published your website/page/posts, it is normal for it to take some time for Google to index it. Typically, it takes 4 days to 4 weeks. In some cases, it may even take up to 6 months, depending on how quickly Google discovers and records the site.\nTo check if your site or page or blog post is actually missing from Google's index, you can do a quick search on Google using the \"site:yourwebsite.com\" query. If it doesn't show up in the search results, then you can move on to the next step.\nIf your site is already indexed, you may want to focus on improving its search engine ranking. Visit Increase Search Engine Ranking (SEO) or Optimize Blog Posts for Search Engines\u00a0for tips to enhance your website's ranking.\nNote:\u00a0Meta tags and site descriptions only help increase the site's ranking on Google. They have nothing to do with whether the site will be indexed by Google or not. They don't help Google find the site. Even without meta tags and site descriptions, Google will still find the user\u2019s site.\n2. Ensure your site is not hidden from search engines\nGo to Settings > Show Advanced > Privacy & Legal, and make sure that the \"Hide from Search Engines\" option is unchecked.\n3. Check if there's a password for the site or page or blog post\nTo check if your site has a password, open it in a private browser window. If your site or page has a password, follow these guidelines to remove it:\nHow to remove the password for specific pages?\nHow to remove the password for the website?\nHow to remove the password for a blog post?\n4. Check if the site is properly connected.\nThe site may be using masking/masked forwarding, and this can prevent Google\u2019s spiders from crawling. Visit Fix Problems with Masked Forwarding.\n5. Check if the site is submitted to Google\nAfter adding your site to Google Console, you can Submit Your Sitemap to Google. This may help speed up the indexing process. You can also Ask Google to recrawl your page.\nAdditionally, you can place the URL of your site on another page that is already indexed by Google, which can assist Google in crawling and indexing your site.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nHow long does it take for Google to index a new website?\nTypically, it takes anywhere from 4 days to 4 weeks for Google to index a new website. However, in some cases, it may take up to 6 months depending on various factors.\nWill my free website/page/blog post show up on Google search?\nYes, all websites, whether they are paid or free, have the potential to be indexed by Google. However, it may take some time for new websites or content to be discovered and indexed by Google. To increase visibility, focus on optimizing your content with relevant keywords and following SEO best practices. Regularly updating and promoting your website or blog can also help improve its chances of showing up in Google search results.\nWhat if my website still doesn't show up on Google after following these steps?\nIf your website continues to have visibility issues on Google, you can read more from Google:\u00a0Why is my page missing from Google Search?\nDoes sharing my website on social media help Google index it?\nWhile sharing your website on social media can attract more visitors and potential backlinks, it indirectly contributes to indexing but does not directly impact Google's indexing process. To ensure proper indexing, focus on implementing effective SEO strategies like creating high-quality content and obtaining authoritative backlinks.\nWhat if I changed some of my website content? How can I recrawl my site?\nGoogle offers easy ways to request recrawling of your website. Before starting, make sure your page loads correctly without any coding errors.\nWhen you're ready to proceed with recrawling, you can choose one of these methods:\n1. Use the URL Inspection tool (for a few URLs)\nTo request a crawl of individual URLs, use the URL Inspection tool. You need to be an owner or full user of the Search Console property to request indexing in this tool.\nKeep in mind that there's a limit for submitting individual URLs, and requesting multiple crawls for the same URL won't speed up the process.\n2. Submit a sitemap (for many URLs at once)If you have a lot of URLs, submitting a sitemap is recommended. A sitemap helps Google discover all the pages on your site, which is especially useful if you've recently made changes. It can also include extra information about different language versions, videos, images, or news pages. Learn how to create and submit a sitemap.\nNote that recrawling doesn't happen immediately and results aren't guaranteed. It usually takes a few days, and sometimes a few weeks, for the process to complete.\nRecrawling involves Googlebots discovering new or updated pages on your website and incorporating them into its index. In simpler terms, it is the method used to include webpages in Google search results.\nWhat's the difference between Crawling and Indexing?\nCrawling refers to the process of finding pages and links that lead to additional pages.\nIndexing, on the other hand, involves storing, analyzing, and organizing the content and relationships between these pages. Certain aspects of indexing play a role in guiding the search engine's crawling behavior.\nHave some questions?

Can it be changed to Chinese/other languages?\nAnswer: If you're considering changing the language of your current site, it's not an option at the moment. What we do have is a Language switcher feature that can clone your site and have a version in a different language which is available in our VIP plan (see the list of languages we support here). This feature will automatically clone the content of your webpage to the language that you prefer. Therefore, you will have two versions of the same site in different languages.\nNote:\nIf you're subscribed to the Pro plan, you have the option to clone your site and manually translate its content. It's important to note that automatic website translation is exclusively available in the VIP plan, not in Pro.\nWhile our Language Switcher feature is accessible for all languages, if you select \"Other\" in the language option, you'll need to manually translate your website. Automatic translation is only supported for languages listed in the dropdown menu.\nEmail support@strikingly.com or\u00a0chat\u00a0with us if you have any questions!\nWas this article helpful?\n0 out of 0 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?

Great for storytelling and guiding visitors through your content.\nGrid Layout:\nThe Grid layout arranges content in rows and columns. You can choose how many grids per column and row, as well as adjust the height and spacing between them.

Whether you're aiming to collect leads or direct visitors to specific actions, you have the flexibility to customize the layout to suit your goals.\nImage Position:\nDecide where you want your image to appear within the grid. Whether it's at the top, bottom, or omitted entirely, you can control the visual hierarchy and emphasis of your content.\nBackground Image Customization:\nMake your grid stand out by customizing the background image. You can select an image that complements your content and brand aesthetic, adding visual interest and depth to your grid section.\nHyperlinking Images:\nCheck the \"Clickable\" box to hyperlink your grid's background image.

If you change the font in one section, it will apply to all sections across all pages. However, with our Limited, Pro, and VIP plans, our developers can do custom code editing for you. So, if you need to modify the font in a particular section, we can ask our developers to see if they can accommodate your request.\nDon't worry!

During this timeframe, you just need to sit tight while we work on your project, no need to do anything! But, if our design team requires additional information on or before the completion of the website, they will promptly notify you.

You can start by signing up for an account on the Strikingly website and then utilizing the platform's intuitive tools and templates to create your page. These tools enable you to customize the design, layout, and content of your site to meet your specific needs and preferences.\nWe've made it easier for you by offering pre-designed templates that you can edit to fit your requirements. However, if you prefer to start from scratch, we also provide a blank template for you to use.\nNot only that, our platform also offers drag-and-drop functionality, simplifying the process of adding and arranging elements such as text, images, videos, forms, and more. Additionally, you can enhance your site by integrating various third-party tools and services, such as e-commerce functionality, analytics, and marketing tools.\nOnce your website is created, you have the option to publish it with a Strikingly domain (e.g., yoursite.strikingly.com) or connect your own custom domain. Strikingly provides hosting services for websites, ensuring they are accessible on the internet.\nWhat's really awesome is Strikingly offers customer support and resources to assist our users in navigating the website-building process and troubleshooting any issues they encounter.\nIn case you need assistance, shoot us a line at\u00a0support@strikingly.com\u00a0or\u00a0chat\u00a0with us. :)\nWas this article helpful?\n0 out of 0 found this helpful\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nHave more questions?
